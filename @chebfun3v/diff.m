function F = diff(F, n, dim)
%DIFF   Componentwise derivative of a CHEBFUN3V.
%   DIFF(F) is the derivative of each component of F along the x direction.
%
%   DIFF(F, N) is the Nth derivative of each component of F in the x direction.
%
%   DIFF(F, N, DIM) is the Nth derivative of F along the dimension DIM.
%     DIM = 1 (default) is the derivative in the x-direction.
%     DIM = 2 is the derivative in the y-direction.
%     DIM = 3 is the derivative in the z-direction.
%
%   DIFF(F,[NX NY NZ]) is the partial derivative of NX of F in the first 
%   variable, NY-th derivative of F in the second variable and NZ-th 
%   derivative of F is the third variable. For example, DIFF(F,[2 3 1]) is
%   d^6F/d^2xd^3ydz.

%   DIFF(F,[NX NY]) is the partial derivative of NX of F in the first variable,
%   and NY of F in the second derivative. For example, DIFF(F,[1 2]) is
%   d^3F/dxd^2y.
