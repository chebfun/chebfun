classdef imex < spinscheme
%IMEX   Class for representing implicit-explicit schemes.
%   IMEX is a class for representing implicit-explicit schemes, which are used 
%   for the time integration in SPINSPHERE.
%
% Construction: 
%
%   K = EXPINT(SCHEME) constructs an IMEX object corresponding to the 
%   IMEX scheme SCHEME. SCHEME is a (case-insensitive) STRING.
%
% Available IMEX schemes:
%
%   IMEX BDF: 'imexbdf4' (for diffusive PDEs only)
%
%   IMEX RUNGE-KUTTA: 'lirk4' (for both diffusive and dispersive PDEs)
%
% See also SPINSPHERE.
