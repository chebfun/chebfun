function A = unfold(T, rowDims, colDims)
%UNFOLD     Unfold or flatten or matricize a tensor.
%
%   A = UNFOLD(T, ROWDIMS, COLDIMS) returns an unfolding of T, where 
%   ROWDIMS and COLDIMS are integer vectors denoting the dimensions of T 
%   that are merged into the rows and the columns of the matrix,
%   respectively.
%
%   A = UNFOLD(T, ROWDIMS) chooses COLDIMS automatically to contain all 
%   dimensions not contained in ROWDIMS. The entries of COLDIMS are
%   arranged in ascending order.
%
%   Note that UNFOLD(T, 1:ndims(T)) is the same as to T(:).
%
%   Example
%   T = randn(2, 3, 4, 5);
%   A = unfold(T, [2 4]); % returns a 15x8 matrix

% The structure of this code is similar to `matricize.m` from the HTUCKER 
% toolbox of Tobler and Kressner.
