function h = max(f, g, dim)
%MAX   Maximum value of a CHEBFUN3 in one direction.
%   MAX(f) returns a chebfun2 representing the maximum of the CHEBFUN3 along the
%   x direction, i.e, MAX(f) = @(y,z) max( f(:, y, z) )
%
%   MAX(f, [], dim) returns a CHEBFUN2 representing the maximum of f along the
%   DIM direction. DIM = 1 means along the x-direction, DIM = 2 is along the
%   y-direction, and DIM = 3 means along the z-direction.
%
%   WARNING: This function is not always accurate to the expected precision. 
% 
%   For the global maximum use MAX3.

% Default to max of one chebfun3:

% Default to maximum along the x direction:
