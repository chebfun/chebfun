function varargout = gradient(f)
%GRAD   Gradient of a CHEBFUN3.
%   [FX FY FZ] = GRAD(F) returns the gradient of the CHEBFUN3 
%   object F, where 
%   FX is the derivative of F in the first variable,
%   FY is the derivative of F in the second varaiable, and 
%   FZ is the derivative of F in the third variable.
%
%   G = GRAD(F) returns a CHEBFUN3V object which represents
%
%            G = (F_x; F_y; F_z)
