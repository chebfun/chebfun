function g = diffz(f, n)
%DIFFZ   Differentiate a CHEBFUN3 with respect to its third argument.
%
%   G = DIFFZ(F) returns a CHEBFUN3 representing the derivative of F in its 
%   second argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,1,3).
%
%   G = DIFFZ(F,N) returns a CHEBFUN3 representing the Nth derivative of F in
%   its second argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,N,3).

% Default to first derivative: 
if ( nargin == 1 ) 
    n = 1; 
end

% Call diff:
g = diff(f, n, 3);
