function h = ldivide(f, g)
%.\   Pointwise left array divide for CHEBFUN3 objects.
%   F.\G returns (1/F)*G, if G is a CHEBFUN3 and F is a double.
%
%   F.\G returns G/F, if G is double and F is a CHEBFUN3, but this does
%   not work if F becomes numerically close to zero.
% 
%   F.\G is the same as the command ldivide(F,G).
