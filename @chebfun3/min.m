function h = min(f, g, dim)
%MIN   Minimum value of a CHEBFUN3 in one direction.
%
%   MIN(F) returns a chebfun2 representing the minimum of the CHEBFUN3 
%   along the x direction, i.e, MIN(F) = @(y,z) min(F(:, y, z))
%
%   MIN(F, [], DIM) returns a CHEBFUN2 representing the minimum of F along 
%   the DIM direction. DIM = 1 means along the x-direction, DIM = 2 is 
%   along the y-direction, and DIM = 3 means along the z-direction.
%
%   WARNING: This function is not always accurate to the expected precision.
% 
%   For the global minimum use MIN3.
