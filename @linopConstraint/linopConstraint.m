classdef linopConstraint
%LINOPCONSTRAINT Class for linop constraints.
%
%   A linop operates on a set of chebfuns and scalars (the "variables" of the
%   linop). An instance of this class may be assigned to the 'constraint'
%   property of a linop in order to impose a constraint on that variable (for
%   purposes of solving a linear system or eigenvalue problem).
% 
%   Each LINOPCONSTRAINT object has a 'functional' property, which is a
%   chebmatrix of vertically concatenated functionalBlocks, and a 'values'
%   property, a vector of the same length. If u is the variable of the
%   linop, then the constraint imposed by object C is:
%
%        C.functional * u = C.values.
%
%   The preferred way to add contraints to a linop is through LINOP.ADDBC,
%   not through direct use of this class.
%
% See also LINOP, LINOP.ADDBC.

        %   This is useful at the CHEBOP level, where we need different signs
        %   for the boundary conditions of a LINOP when we call LINOP(N) where N
        %   is a CHEBOP, compared to what we want when we call LINEARIZE() from
        %   within a Newton iteration. This is because when problems are solved
        %   with LINOP backslash, the solution to the problem is the output
        %   itself, while in a Newton iteration, we have to add the output of
        %   the LINOP solution to the current guess.
