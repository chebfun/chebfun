function B = getConstraints(disc)
%APPLYCONSTRAINTS   Modify discrete operator to accommodate constraints.
%   M = APPLYCONSTRAINTS(DISC, BLOCKS) uses a cell of matrix BLOCKS created by
%   the discretization DISC in order to return a matrix that incorporates both
%   the linear operator and its constraints.
%
%   [M, P, B, A] = APPLYCONSTRAINTS(DISC, BLOCKS) also returns the individual
%   matrices that represent down-projection of the operator (P), boundary,
%   continuity, and other constraints (B), and the original operator (A). The
%   output M is equivalent to M = [B ; P*A] and is square.
