		                  Chebfun Version 5.0

Chebfun Version 5.0 is compatible with MATLAB 7.6 (2008a) and above.

Installation instructions:

1. Unzip the contents of the zip file to a directory. We suggest the name
   "chebfun" for this directory. Make sure to maintain the existing subdirectory 
   structure of the zip package. (Please note: If you install into the "toolbox" 
   subdirectory of the MATLAB program hierarchy, you will need to click the 
   button "Update toolbox path cache" from the File/Preferences... dialog in 
   MATLAB.)

2. In MATLAB, add the chebfun directory to your path. This can be done by
   selecting "File/Set Path..." from the main or Command window menus, or with
   the command "pathtool". We recommend that you select the "Save" button on
   this dialog so that Chebfun is on the path automatically in future MATLAB
   sessions.  (Alternatively, you can put an "addpath" command in your startup.m 
   file, as described in the MATLAB documentation.)

3. A restart of MATLAB may be needed if you want to access the user guides via 
   the Help browser.

Point your web browser to the guide/html directory of the Chebfun installation
in order to read the user guides.
