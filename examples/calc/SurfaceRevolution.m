%%
% A surface of revolution can be created by rotating a planar generator curve
% around an axis lying in the same plane as the curve. A classical example is
% the unit sphere, which is obtained by rotating $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ defined on
% $[-1,1]$ around the x-axis. Here we have to rotate $\sqrt{1.0001-x^2}$
% because Chebfun2 cannot represent functions with square roots
% singularities. 

x = chebfun('x');
f = sqrt(1.0001-x.^2);
plot(f), axis equal
snapnow
cylinder(f), axis equal

%%
% An even simpler example is a cone, which is constructed by rotating a linear
% polynomial around an axis.

%%
% We have overloaded Matlab's cylinder command in Chebfun so that we can create
% a surface of revolution from a chebfun. The chebfun defines the radius along
% the unit height of the cylinder. Omitting output arguments causes the cylinder
% to be displayed with a surf command and no outputs to be returned. The cone
% can be constructed as follows:

f = chebfun(@(x) -3*x + 3);
cylinder(f)

%%
% By default the surface of revolution has height 1 and is displayed as if the
% generator curve was rotated around the $z$-axis. We can get the
% $(x,y,z)$-coordinates, stretch the $z$-coordinates to match the interval of
% definition of the generator chebfun, and rearrange the coordinates so that the
% generator chebfun is rotated around the $x$-axis:

f = chebfun(@(x) 2.8*sin(0.2*x - 0.1) + 6.3, [-5 35]);
dom = f.domain;
[xx, yy, zz] = cylinder(f);
zzstr = diff(dom)*zz + dom(1);
surf(zzstr,flipud(yy),xx)

%%
% Let us create yet another surface and study some of its properties within Chebfun.

x = chebfun('x', [0 2*pi]);
f = sqrt(4 + 2*sin(2*x));
[xx, yy, zz] = cylinder(f);
surf(xx,yy,zz)

%%
% The volume of this object can be computed as $$ V = \pi \int_a^b f^2(x)\,
% \mathrm{d}x. $$ This is a basic computation in Chebfun and we compare the
% result with the exact value:

V = pi*sum(f.^2)
abs(V - 8*pi^2) 

%%
% The area of the surface is given by $$ A = 2\pi \int_a^b
% f(x)\sqrt{1+|f'(x)|^2}\, \mathrm{d}x. $$

A = 2*pi*sum(f.*sqrt(1 + abs(diff(f)).^2))

%%
% The coordinates of the center of gravity are $x_G=0, y_G=0$ and $$ z_G =
% \frac{\pi}{V} \int_a^b x f^2(x)\, \mathrm{d}x. $$

zG = pi/V*sum(x.*f.^2)
hold on
colormap hsv, alpha(.1)
plot3(0,0,zG,'.r','MarkerSize',40)
hold off

%%
% Finally we compute the moment of inertia, assuming that the object is
% homogeneous with density 1, $$ J = \frac{\pi}{2} \int_a^b f^4(x)\,
% \mathrm{d}x. $$

J = pi/2*sum(f.^4)

%%
% And a last one:
fls = chebfun('1./(1+8*x.^2)');
[xx, yy, zz] = cylinder(fls);
surf(xx,yy,zz/4)
axis equal
hold on
h = findobj('type', 'axes');
