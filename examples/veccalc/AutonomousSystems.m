%% Autonomous systems
% An autonomous system is a system of ordinary differential equations which does
% not explicitly depend on the independent variable. Such a system can be
% written in the form of $dy/dt(t) = f(y(t))$ where $y(t)$ takes values in
% $R^n$. In this example we restrict ourselves to $n = 2$ so that we can plot
% the phase plane (vector field) and trajectory of $y(t)$ given initial
% conditions using Chebfun2.

%% Simple harmonic oscillator
% We start by looking at the familiar simple harmonic oscillator.

phasedom = [-1 1 -3 3]; w = 2;        % phase plane domain
F = chebfun2v(@(x,y)y, @(x,y)-w.^2.*x, phasedom);
for ic = .1:.2:1                      % initial conditions
    [t, y] = ode45(F,[0 4],[ic,0]);   % solve autonomous system
    plot(y,'r'), hold on              % plot trajectory
end
quiver(F,'b'), hold on

%% 
% The chebfun2v F is a vector field, and the overloaded ode45 command is used to
% compute its trajectories. Each trajectory is represented by a complex valued
% chebfun y parameterised by the real time variable t.

%% Nonlinear pendulum
% Here is another familiar phase plane with slightly more interesting
% trajectories:

phasedom = [-4 4 -2 2];               % phase plane domain
F = chebfun2v(@(x,y)y,@(x,y)-sin(x)/4,phasedom);
for ic = .5:.5:3                        % initial conditions
    [t, y]=ode45(F, [0 40], [ic,0]);     % solve autonomous system
    plot(y,'r'), hold on                 % plot trajectory
end
quiver(F,'b'), axis equal                 % vector field

%% Duffing oscillator
% The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear second order differential equation that
% models a damped oscillator. It has three critical points, two stable and one
% unstable.  Here is the phase portrait with a carefully selected trajectory:

d = 0.04; a=1; b=-.75;
F = chebfun2v(@(x,y)y, @(x,y)-d*y - b*x - a*x.^3, [-2 2 -2 2]);
[t y]=ode45(F,[0 40],[0,.5]);
plot(y,'r'), hold on
quiver(F,'b'), axis equal

%% 
% The critical points can be located using the roots command:

r = roots(F)       % Find critical points and display them.
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.','markersize',30)

% Some of the code found in this Example can also be found in [1] along with
% additional information about autonomous systems in Chebfun2.
