%% The Chebfun2 constructor and rectangular domains
% Chebfun2's constructor performs Gaussian elimination with
% complete pivoting on matrices and hence is inherently tied to sampling 
% a function at adaptively 
% selected tensor grids. Note that the grids are carefully selected so the 
% complexity is reduced for low rank functions [5].  However, we can still 
% represent functions on non-rectangular domains using Chebfun2 by employing 
% mappings. In this Example we explore Chebfun2 on a few non-rectangular 
% domains.

%% What can Chebfun2 do already? 
% You may be surprised to learn that Chebfun2 can already do some
% operations on non-rectangular domains. For example, Chebfun2 can
% calculate the volume of a simple function on an arbitrary domain with
% prescribed boundary:

f = chebfun2(@(x,y) x.^2 + y.^2); 
c = chebfun(@(t) cos(pi*t) + 1i*sin(2*pi*t),[-.5 .5]);
plot(c,'k',LW,lw), hold on, contour(f), axis equal
fprintf('Volume enclosed by curve = %1.3f\n',integral2(f,c))

%%
% Chebfun2v objects can also represent surfaces. Of course, these surfaces 
% must be expressed in terms of a rectangular coordinate system. For
% example, we can take a chebfun and revolve it around the z-axis:

clf
f = chebfun(@(x) x.*(5-x) + sin(pi*x),[0 5]);
F = cylinder(f); 
surf(F)

%% 
% We can even represent and manipulate functions on such surfaces, see, for
% example, [2,3,4] and the Chebfun2 guide.

%% Sector domain
% Sector shaped domains are rectangular when parametrised by polar coordinates 
% $r_1\leq r\leq r_2$, $\theta_1\leq \theta \leq \theta_2$ and thus functions
% on these domains can be easily represented using Chebfun2. For example,
% take the following sector: 

t1 = pi/6; t2 = 7/4*pi; r1 = 1/2; r2 = 2; 
t = chebfun('t',[t1 t2]); r = chebfun('r',[r1 r2]);
sector = join( r2*exp(1i*t), r1*exp(1i*t), r*exp(1i*t1), r*exp(1i*t2) ); 
plot(sector,'k',LW,lw), axis(2*[-1 1 -1 1]), axis equal, hold on,
title('Sector domain',FS,fs)

%%
% We can represent functions on such a sector by introducing polar
% coordinates: 
r = chebfun2(@(r,t) r,[r1 r2 t1 t2]);
t = chebfun2(@(r,t) t,[r1 r2 t1 t2]);
[x,y] = pol2cart(t,r);
f = cos(5*x.*y) + y; 
surf([x;y;f])
title('Function on sector domain',FS,fs)

%%
% Since the Jacobian of the change of variables is well-behaved we can, 
% for example, calculate the integral of $f$ over the sector domain: 

integral2(f.*jacobian([x;y]))

%% Warping the sector domain 
% Moreover, we can represent functions on more general domains such as the following
% warped sector domain: 
clf
r = chebfun2(@(r,t) r + .1*cos(5*t),[r1 r2 t1 t2]);
t = chebfun2(@(r,t) t,[r1 r2 t1 t2]);
[x,y] = pol2cart(t,r);
f = cos(5*x.*y) + y; 
surf([x;y;f]), view(0,90), axis equal, hold off
title('Function on warped sector domain',FS,fs)

%% 
% Even for this warped sector domain the Jacobian is non-zero everywhere
% and computing with the function using the implicit
% change of variables is possible: 

plot(jacobian([x;y])), title('Jacobian',FS,fs)

%% Shadow of a Klein bottle
% Even further we can represent the same function on the shadow of the 
% 3-dimensional immersion of the Klein bottle:
clf
u = chebfun2(@(u,v) u, [0 pi 0 2*pi]);
v = chebfun2(@(u,v) v, [0 pi 0 2*pi]);

x = -(2/15)*cos(u).*(3*cos(v)-30*sin(u)+90*cos(u).^4.*sin(u)- 60*cos(u).^6.*sin(u)+5*cos(u).*cos(v).*sin(u));
y = -(1/15)*sin(u).*(3*cos(v)-3*cos(u).^2.*cos(v)-48*cos(u).^4.*cos(v)+48*cos(u).^6.*cos(v)-60*sin(u)+5*cos(u).*cos(v).*sin(u) ...
    -5*cos(u).^3.*cos(v).*sin(u)-80*cos(u).^5.*cos(v).*sin(u)+80*cos(u).^7.*cos(v).*sin(u));
f = cos(5*x.*y) + y; 
surf([x;y;f]), view(0,90)

%%
% However, in this case the Jacobian becomes singular and most operations
% on the rectanglar domain becomes meaningless:

plot(jacobian([x;y])), title('Jacobian',FS,fs)

%% The significance of conformal maps 
% A conformal map is a holomorphic function whose derivative does not 
% vanish (hence it preserves angles). This can be seen as a special case
% of a change of variables. While conformal maps can be used they 
% are not essential for extending Chebfun2 to non-rectangular domains. 

%% Method of frames
% For a different approach to representing functions on non-rectangular
% domains see [1].
