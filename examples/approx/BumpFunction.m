%% Adding bumps
% A Gaussian bump happens to be a rank-1 function because it can be written as a
% product of univariate functions [2]. That is, $$e^{-\gamma(x^2+y^2)} =
% e^{-\gamma x^2}e^{-\gamma y^2}.$$ To illustrate Chebfun2, we can shift these
% Gaussian bump functions to arbitrary locations and add them together. In this
% experiment we add up 100 of them:

FS='FontSize'; fs=16;

gam=100; j=1;
f = chebfun2(0);
for n = 1:100
    x0 = 2*rand-1; y0 = 2*rand-1;
    df = chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-gam*((x-x0).^2+(y-y0).^2)));
    f = f + df;    
    if n == 1 || n==5 || n==50 || n==100
        subplot(2,2,j), plot(f), title(sprintf('n=%u',n),FS,fs), j=j+1;
        zlim([0,5])
    end
    n
end

%% The surprise 
% Generically, the sum of 100 rank-1 functions is a rank-100 function. However,
% in this case the numerical rank is significantly less than the mathematical
% rank:

fprintf('Rank of function is %u\n',rank(f))

%% Why the surprise?
% If you write the bivariate function in terms of its singular value
% decomposition [2] $$f(x,y)   \approx   \sum  \sigma_k \phi_k(x) \psi_k(y),$$
% the singular values decay supergeometrically. This phenomenon is exploited in
% the Fast Gauss Transform [1]. Here is a plot showing the supergeometric decay:

clf, semilogy(svd(f))
title('Decay of singular values of f',FS,fs),legend('SVD')
xlabel('Index',FS,fs),ylabel('Magnitude',FS,fs)

%% Playing around
% Once we have a function we can also see what it looks like along a
% cross-section (like along $y=\pi/12$), which is represented by a smooth
% chebfun:

plot(f(:,pi/12)), title('Cross-section along y=\pi/12',FS,fs)

%%
% Or, we can calculate its maximum along each column, a function which is
% represented by a piecewise smooth chebfun with several points of discontinuity
% of its slope:

plot(max(f)), title('Maximum in the y-direction',FS,fs)
xlabel('x',FS,fs), ylabel('Maximum',FS,fs)

%% Global maximum
% We can also compute its global maximum, shown below as a black dot:

[m,X] = max2(f);
plot(f), hold on, plot3(X(1),X(2),m,'k.','MarkerSize',30), zlim([0,5])
title('Global maximum of f',FS,fs)
