%% 
% In Chebfun2 we would like to be able to find the roots of a bivariate
% polynomial system.  That is, find (x,y) such that
%      $$F(x,y) =  ( f(x,y), g(x,y) ) = 0.$$ 

%%
% A suggestion by John Boyd of the University of Michigan for finding the zeros
% of a system of polynomials goes by the name of is Marching Triangles [5]. This
% works by determining the zero contours of $f$ and $g$ separately, and to
% achieve this the algorithm subdivides the domain many small triangles.  On
% each triangle it approximates $f$ (or $g$) by a piecewise linear polynomial,
% and there are two possible cases:
%%
% (1) The values of the function at the vertices are all of the same sign. 
%%
% (2) One function value is of a different sign to the others. 
%%
% If (1) holds then the triangle is marked as not containing a zero contour. If
% (2) holds, then a linear polynomial $p(x) = ax + by + c$ is formed which
% interpolates the three vertices and the zero contour of $f$ in that triangle
% is approximated by the zero line of $p(x)$.  Further subdivision is taken in
% triangles which are deemed to contain a zero contour.
%
% The Matlab command contourc uses Marching Squares [4] (a similar technique but
% subdividing with squares instead of triangles). This algorithm is employed by
% contour, contours and contourf, and implemented in contourc. One of the
% Chebfun Examples is based on the contourc command [1].

%%
% Chebfun2 uses the Matlab contourc to find the zero contours of a single
% function $f(x,y)$, and is employed with the command roots(f).

%% Zero contours
% Let's solve a problem from [2] of finding the solution to f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0:

d = [-4 4 -4 4]; 
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*y.*cos(y.^2).*cos(2*x)-cos(y),d);
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*sin(y.^2).*sin(2*x)-sin(x),d);

%% 
% This example was derived from an autonomous system of ODEs. Here are the zero
% contours computed by Marching Squares.

plot(roots(g),'r'), hold on, plot(roots(f),'g')

%% Solutions to bivariate systems
% A different problem is to find the isolated solutions to a bivariate system
% $f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0$. In Chebfun2 we compute the solutions to this problem by
% first computing the zero contours of f and g by marching squares, and then
% using their intersections as initial guesses in a Newton iteration.  The
% solutions to $f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0$ can be computed by the command roots(f,g,'ms')
% in Chebfun2.

%% 
% For example we can find all the solutions to the example above with the
% following code:

r = roots(f,g, 'ms'); 
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'.k','MarkerSize',20), hold off

%% Trott's curve
% Trott's curve an important curve in algebraic geometry.  Here we use the
% compute roots(f,g) to compute the intersections between trotts curves and the
% zero contours of $f(x,y) = y-x^6$.

trott = @(x,y) 144*(x.^4+y.^4)-225*(x.^2+y.^2) + 350*x.^2.*y.^2+81;
f = chebfun2(trott); 
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) y-x.^6); 
plot(roots(f),'b'), hold on, plot(roots(g),'r'), axis equal
r = roots(f,g, 'ms'); 
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.','MarkerSize',30), hold off

%% A function with several local minima
% The roots command in Chebfun2 can also be used to compute the local extrema of
% a function $f(x,y)$ because they satisfy $df/dx = df/dy = 0$.

f = chebfun2(@(x,y) (x.^2-y.^3+1/8).*sin(10*x.*y));
r = roots(gradient(f), 'ms');            % critical points
plot(roots(diff(f,1,2)),'b'), hold on    % plot zero contours of f_x
plot(roots(diff(f)),'r')                 % plot zero contours of f_y
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.','MarkerSize',30) % plot extrema

%% 
% Note that we have used the gradient command in Chebfun2 which computes the x
% and y derivative of f.

%% More information 
% The last example can also be found in [3] along with additional information
% about the rootfinding algorithm in Chebfun2.
