%% First year undergraduate probability
% One of the first year undergraduate courses at Oxford is probability, which
% introduces basic concepts such as discrete and continuous random variables,
% probability density functions (pdf), and probability generating functions. A
% standard example for probability density functions of continuous random
% variables is the bivariate normal distribution.

%% The joint normal distribution
% After 3 to 4 weeks the students are taught about marginal and conditional
% distributions, and an early example is the standard bivariate normal
% distribution, where two normal distributions X and Y are coupled together. In
% this example we use Chebfun2 to compute numerically with the bivariate normal
% distribution.

FS = 'FontSize'; fs = 16;

mu1 = 0; mu2 = 0;          % means
sigma1 = 1; sigma2 = 1;    % variances
rho = .5;                  % coupling 
d = 10*[-1 1 -1 1];        % truncated domain             
z = @(x,y) (x-mu1).^2./sigma1^2 - 2*rho*(x-mu1).*(y-mu2)/sigma1/sigma2 +...
    (y-mu2).^2./sigma2^2; 
p =chebfun2(@(x,y) 1/(2*pi*sigma1*sigma2*sqrt(1-rho^2))*...
    exp(-z(x,y)./(2*(1-rho^2))), d); % bivariate joint pdf

%% Integrates to one
% A joint density function is still a pdf, so it must integrate to 1

fprintf('Integral of pdf %1.16f\n', integral2(p))

%% 
% The integral above is less than 1 because of numerical error and not because
% we have restricted the domain of the probability density function to
% [-10,10,10,-10].

%% Marginal distributions
% There are two marginal distributions that can be computed by integrating out
% the other variable. For instance, the marginal distribution in X is the
% probability distribution after averaging over information about Y. This can be
% calculated by just integration over y with the sum command (sum of a chebfun2
% defaults to integration over y).

px = sum(p); 
plot(px), 
title('Marginal distribution', FS, fs)

%%
% A fundamental property is that each marginal distribution is a univariate 
% normal distribution:

exact = chebfun(@(x) 1/(sqrt(2*pi)*sigma1)*...
                              exp(-(x-mu1).^2./sigma1^2/2),d(1:2));
fprintf('Error of marginal = %1.3e\n',norm(px-exact')) 

%% Conditional probability distributions
% Given that we know the realisation of $X$, what is the probability density
% function of Y? This is the called conditional probability, and associated is
% the concept of condition probability distributions. We can use Chebfun2 to
% compute numerically the conditional probability distribution. We must restrict
% the domain to $[-2,2] \times [-2,2]$ to prevent a NaN error.

d = 2*[-1 1 -1 1]; 
fy = p./chebfun2(@(x,y) px(x), d); % conditional pdf

% plot and compute error
plot(fy)


%% 
% For the bivariate normal distribution the condition probability distribution
% is known explicitly.  We can use this to check the accuracy of the conditional
% probability computed by Chebfun2 if the realisation of $X$ is, say, $\pi/6$:

x = pi/6;  % realisation of X

% exact conditional probability distribution 
mu = mu1 + sigma1/sigma2*rho*(x-mu2); sigmasq = (1-rho^2)*sigma1^2;
exact = chebfun(@(x) 1/(sqrt(2*pi*sigmasq))*...
                                 exp(-(x-mu).^2./sigmasq/2),d(1:2));
fprintf('Error in conditional pdf is %1.5e\n',norm(fy(x,:)-exact));
