function chebvals = chebcoeffs2chebvals(chebcoeffs)
%CHEBCOEFFS2CHEBVALS  Convert Chebyshev coefficients to values.
%   CHEBVALS = CHEBCOEFFS2CHEBVALS(CHEBCOEFFS), converts the column vector
%   CHEBCOEFFS of Chebyshev coefficients in the Chebyshev series
%       F(X) = C_CHEB(1)*T0(X) + ... + C_CHEB(N)*T{N-1}(X), 
%   to a vector CHEBVALS of values of the expansion at second-kind Chebyshev
%   points, i.e.,
%       CHEBVALS = F(CHEBPTS(N));
