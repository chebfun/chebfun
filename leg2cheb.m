function c_cheb = leg2cheb(c_leg, normalize, M)
%LEG2CHEB convert Legendre coefficients to Chebyshev coefficients. 
%   C_CHEB = LEG2CHEB(C_LEG) converts the vector C_LEG of Legendre coefficients
%   to a vector C_CHEB of Chebyshev coefficients such that 
%       C_CHEB(1)*T0 + ... + C_CHEB(N)*T{N-1} = ...
%           C_LEG(N)*P0 + ... + C_LEG(1)*P{N-1}, 
%   where P{k} is the degree k Legendre polynomial normalized so that max(|P{k}|
%   = 1.
% 
%   C_CHEB = LEG2CHEB(C_LEG, 'norm') is as above, but with the Legendre
%   polynomials normalized to be orthonormal.
%
%   If C_LEG is a matrix then the LEG2CHEB operation is applied to each column.
