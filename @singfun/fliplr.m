function f = fliplr(f)
%FLIPLR   Flip columns of an array-valued SINGFUN object.
%   FLIPLR(F) flips the columns of an array-valued SINGFUN in the left/right
%   direction. If F has only one column, then this function has no effect.

% Flip the orders of the columns of the matrices storing the values and

%[TODO]: Not done yet because this relies on array-valued SINGFUNs
