%SINGFUN   Class for functions with singular endpoint behavior.
%
%   Class for approximating singular functions on the interval [-1,1] using a
%   smooth part with no singularities and two singular factors (1+x).^a and
%   (1-x).^b, where a and b are real numbers.
%
%   SINGFUN class description
%
%   The SINGFUN class represents a function of the form
%
%          f(x) = s(x) (1+x)^a (1-x)^b
%
%   on the interval [-1,1]. The exponents a and b are assumed to be real. The
%   constructor is supplied with a handle that evaluates the function f at any
%   given points within the interval [-1,1]. The endpoint values are likely to
%   return Inf or NaN results.
%
%   Ideally, the "smooth" function s(x) is analytic, or at least much more
%   compactly represented than f is. The resulting object can be used to
%   evaluate and operate on the function f. If a and b are unknown at the time
%   of construction, the constructor will try to determine appropriate values
%   automatically by sampling the function handle. Note, however, that this
%   process is not completely robust, and the singular terms in general do not
%   perfectly factor out singular behavior. The constructor can be forced to
%   consider only integer exponents.
%
%   Multiplication and division are as good as the corresponding operations on
%   the smooth part. Addition and subtraction are much less reliable, as the sum
%   of two SINGFUN objects with different exponents is not necessarily a
%   SINGFUN, nor a smooth function. If all but integer exponents can be factored
%   out of the summands, the process is fine, but in other circumstances the
%   process may throw an error.
%
%   SINGFUN(OP) constructs a SINGFUN object from the function handle OP. It
%   first tries to determine the type and the order of the singularities or the
%   roots at the endpoints by sampling near -1 and 1 and then forms a new
%   operator which governs the smooth part of OP by factoring out the end point
%   singularities. Finally it constructs an approximation of the smooth part by
%   calling the SMOOTHFUN constructor. The type and the order of the
%   singularities along with the SMOOTHFUN representation of the smooth part are
%   stored in corresponding member fields of the instantiation.
%
%   SINGFUN(OP, DATA) constructs a SINGFUN object using the data in the MATLAB
%   structure DATA.  DATA fields recognized by SINGFUN are.
%     DATA.SINGTYPE    (Default:  Determined by CHEBFUNPREF)
%         A 1x2 cell array of strings and type of the singularities specified
%         by these strings may help the singularity detector to determine the
%         order of the singularities more efficiently and save some computing
%         time.  Valid strings for SINGTYPE are 'none', 'pole', 'sing' or
%         'root'.
%     DATA.EXPONENTS   (Default:  Empty)
%         If DATA.EXPONENTS is nonempty, then instead of determining the
%         singularity types and orders by sampling the function values at -1
%         and 1, the constructor takes the values saved in the 1x2 vector
%         EXPONENTS as the orders of the singularities.
%   If any fields in DATA are empty or not supplied, or if DATA itself is empty
%   or not supplied, appropriate default values are set.  Any fields in DATA
%   which are not recognized will be passed as-is to the SMOOTHFUN constructor.
%
%   SINGFUN(OP, DATA, PREF) constructs a SINGFUN using the preferences given by
%   PREF.

%% DEVELOPER NOTES:
%   It is a Matlab requirement to specify exactly which classes are inferior to
%   a given class. One might think that writing "InferiorClasses = {?smoothfun}"
%   should be OK but it turns out that subclasses do not inherit the attribute
%   of being inferior and all inferior clases/subclasses should be mentioned 
%   explicitly.
