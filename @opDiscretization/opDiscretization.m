% DEVELOPER NOTE:
%   Objects of this class store a source (either a CHEBMATRIX or a LINOP),
%   domain, and dimension (vector of discretization lengths). In other words,
%   they have a CHEBMATRIX or LINOP object, which represent an abstract linear
%   operator (with or without constraints). Most importantly, objects of types
%   of concrete implementation of OPDISCRETIZATION are able to instantianate
%   themselves to a matrix corresponding to discretization of the operator on a
%   Chebyshev grid. Objects of this type also have to implement a mldivide
%   (backslash) method, which yields solution to problems of ODEs.
