function intNum = whichInterval(disc, location, direction)
%WHICHINTERVAL Index of the subinterval of a given point and direction. 
%   INTNUM = WHICHINTERVAL(DISC, LOC, DIRN) returns which interval within
%   DISC.domain a given point LOC is located in. The DIRN is +1 or -1 and
%   indicates approach from the right or left (zero means don't care).
