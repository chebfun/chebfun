function f = or(f, g)
%|   CLASSICFUN logical OR.
%   F | G performs a logical OR of the CLASSICFUN objects F and G and returns a CLASSICFUN
%   containing elements set to either logical 1 (TRUE) or logical 0 (FALSE).
%   An element of the output CLASSICFUN is set to 1 if either input CLASSICFUN contains a
%   non-zero element at that point, otherwise it is set to 0.  F and G must
%   either be identically zero or have roots in their domains.  If this is not
%   the case, garbage is returned with no warning.
