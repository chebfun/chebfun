classdef classicfun < fun % (Abstract)
%CLASSICFUN   Represent global functions on an interval [a, b].
%
%   Abstract (interface) class for representing global functions on an interval
%   [a, b], which can either be bounded or unbounded. Functions are
%   approximated via a ONEFUN object, which lives on the interval [-1, 1],
%   stored in the CLASSICFUN.  Forward and inverse maps stored in the
%   CLASSICFUN object map the interval [-1, 1] to [a, b], and vice versa.
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   CLASSICFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP) constructs a CLASSICFUN object from the function
%   handle OP on the domain determined by the default stored in CHEBFUNPREF by
%   mapping the domain to [-1, 1], and constructing an ONEFUN object to
%   represent the function prescribed by OP.
%
%   CLASSICFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, DATA) does the same but uses the domain
%   specified by DATA.DOMAIN.  If DATA or DATA.DOMAIN is empty or if DATA has
%   no DOMAIN field, the default domain from CHEBFUNPREF is used.  The DATA
%   structure is passed as-is to the appropriate concrete subclass constructor.
%
%   CLASSICFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, DATA, PREF) overrides the default behavior with
%   that given by the preferences in the structure or CHEBFUNPREF object PREF.
%   See CHEBFUNPREF for details.

% See ONEFUN for further documentation of the ONEFUN class.

% CLASSICFUN Class Description:
%
% The CLASSICFUN class is an abstract class for representations of functions on
% the interval [a, b]. It achieves this by taking a ONEFUN on [-1, 1] and
% applying a mapping.
%
% The current instances of CLASSICFUNs are BNDFUNs and UNBNDFUNs. The former
% are used to represent functions on bounded domains, whereas the latter are
% able to represent some functions on unbounded domains.
%
% Note that all binary CLASSICFUN operators (methods which can take two
% CLASSICFUN arguments) assume that the domains of the CLASSICFUN objects
% agree. The methods will not throw warnings in case the domains don't agree,
% but their output will not be meaningful.
