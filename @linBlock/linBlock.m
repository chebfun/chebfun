% DEVELOPER NOTE:
%
% A LINBLOCK is an abstract representation of a linear operator on a single
% function defined on a fixed domain. Its main purpose is to maintain an
% unevaluated stack of algebraic steps operating on predefined building blocks.
% It also keeps track of the differential order of the operator.
%
% The reason for the 'Block' name is that these objects can be a block entry in
% a chebmatrix, for operators that apply to a mixture of multiple functions and
% scalars. The preferred usage externally is to create a 1x1 chebmatrix or linop
% rather than to manipulate the blocks themselves.
%
% The stack is used three different ways within the system:
%       (1) Replace the building blocks with appropriate matrices, and then
%           apply the algebra. (I.e., collocation.) 
%       (2) Derive the coefficients of each power of the derivative. 
%           (See the method toCoeff.) 
%       (3) Convert to a callable function that can be applied directly to a
%           CHEBFUN. (See the method toFunction.)
