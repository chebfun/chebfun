function outputSpace = getOutputSpace( source )
%GETOUTPUTSPACE    Obtain the range of the ultrapspherical spectral operator.
%
% OUT = GETOUTPUTSPACE( SOURCE ) returns OUT to indiciate which ultrapsherical
% polynomial basis to represent the range of the operator. The ultrapsherical
% polynomial basis is choice so that the differential operator remains sparse.
% Roughly, if the leading term is of diffOrder K, then the range should be
% represented in the C^{(K)} polynomial basis.
