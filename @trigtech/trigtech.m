classdef trigtech < smoothfun % (Abstract)
%TRIGTECH   Approximate smooth periodic functions on [-1,1] with trigonometric 
%           interpolants.
%
%   Class for approximating smooth periodic functions on the interval [-1,1]
%   using function values at equally spaced points on [-1,1).
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   TRIGTECH(OP) constructs a TRIGTECH object from the function handle OP. OP
%   should be vectorized (i.e., accept a vector input) and ouput a vector of the
%   same length. TRIGTECH objects allow for array-valued construction (i.e., of
%   array-valued function), in which case OP should accept a vector of length N
%   and return a matrix of size NxM, where M is number of columns of the multi
%   -valued function.
%
%   TRIGTECH(OP, DATA) constructs a TRIGTECH using the additional data
%   supplied in the DATA structure.  Fields currently recognized are:
%     DATA.VSCALE    (Default:  0)
%     DATA.HSCALE    (Default:  1)
%         The constructor builds a TRIGTECH with 'happiness' (see
%         HAPPINESSCHECK.m) relative to the maximum of the given vertical scale
%         DATA.VSCALE and the (column-wise) infinity norm of the sampled
%         function values of OP, and the fixed horizontal scale DATA.HSCALE.
%   If any fields in DATA are empty or not supplied, or if DATA itself is empty
%   or not supplied, appropriate default values are set.
%
%   TRIGTECH(OP, DATA, PREF) overrides the default behavior with that given by
%   the preference structure PREF.
%
%   TRIGTECH(VALUES, ...) returns a TRIGTECH object which interpolates the
%   values in the columns of VALUES at equally spaced points and
%   TRIGTECH({VALUES, COEFFS}, ... ) uses the trig-coefficients passed in
%   COEFFS rather than computing them. If COEFFS are passed, the resulting
%   TRIGTECH is always deemed 'happy'.
%
% Examples: % Basic construction: f = trigtech(@(x) exp(sin(pi*x)))
%
%   % Construction with preferences:
%   p.sampleTest = 0; % See TRIGTECH.TECHPREF for details
%   f = trigtech(@(x) sin(x), [], [], p)
%
%   % Array-valued construction:
%   f = trigtech(@(x) tanh([sin(pi*x), cos(pi*x), cos(pi*sin(pi*x))]))

% TRIGTECH Class Description:
%
% The TRIGTECH class is for representations of smooth periodic functions on the
% interval [-1,1] via interpolated function values at equally spaced points
% using trigonometric Fourier series.
%
% The vertical scale VSCALE is used to enforce scale invariance in TRIGTECH
% construction and subsequent operations. For example, that
%   trigtech(@(x) 2^300*f(x)) = 2^300*trigtech(@(x) f(x)).
%
% VSCALE may be optionally passed to the constructor (if not, it defaults to 0),
% and during construction it is updated to be the maximum magnitude of the
% sampled function values. Similarly the horizontal scale HSCALE is used to
% enforce scale invariance when the input OP has been implicitly mapped from a
% domain other than [-1 1] before being passed to the TRIGTECH constructor.
%
% EPSLEVEL is the happiness level to which the TRIGTECH was constructed (See
% HAPPINESSCHECK.m for full documentation) or a rough accuracy estimate of
% subsequent operations, both relative to VSCALE. Therefore EPSLEVEL could be
% regarded as the number of correct digits in the sampled value that created
% VSCALE.
%
% Here is a rough guide to how scale and accuracy information is propagated in
% subsequent operations after construction:
%   h = f + c:
%     h.vscale = max(abs(f.values), [], 1);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel*f.vscale + eps(c)) / h.vscale;
%
%   h = f * c:
%     h.vscale = abs(c)*f.vscale;
%     h.epslevel = f.epslevel + eps(c)/c;
%
%   h = f + g:
%     h.vscale = max(abs(h.values), [], 1);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel*f.vscale + g.epslevel*g.vscale) / h.vscale
%
%   h = f .* g:
%     h.vscale = max(abs(h.values), [], 1);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel + g.epslevel) * (f.vscale*g.vscale)/h.vscale
%
%   h = diff(f):
%     h.vscale = max(abs(h.values), [], 1);
%     % [TODO]: Figure this out rigourously.
%     h.epslevel = n*log(n)*f.epslevel*f.vscale; % *(h.vscale/h.vscale)
%     % Note we don't divide by h.vscale here as we must also multiply by it.
%
%   h = cumsum(f):
%     h.vscale = max(abs(h.values), [], 1);
%     h.epslevel = happinessCheck(h);
%
% If the input operator OP in a call to TRIGTECH evaluates to NaN or Inf at
% any of the sample points used by the constructor, then an error is thrown.
%
% The TRIGTECH class supports the representation of array-valued functions (for
% example, f = trigtech(@(x) [sin(pi*x), cos(pi*x)])). In such cases, the values
% and coefficients are stored in a matrix (column-wise), and as such each
% component of the array-valued function is truncated to the same length, even
% if the demands of 'happiness' imply that one of the components could be
% truncated to a shorter length than the others. All TRIGTECH methods should
% accept such array-valued forms. Note that this representation is distinct from
% an array of TRIGTECH objects, for which there is little to no support.

        % is then used to enforce horizontal scale invariance in construction
