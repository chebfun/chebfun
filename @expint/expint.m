classdef expint < spinscheme
%EXPINT   Class for representing exponential integrators.
%   EXPINT is a class for representing exponential integrators, which are used 
%   for the time integration in SPIN, SPIN2 and SPIN3.
%
% Construction: 
%
%   K = EXPINT(SCHEME) constructs an EXPINT object corresponding to the 
%   exponential integrator SCHEME. SCHEME is a (case-insensitive) STRING.
%
% Available exponential integrators:
