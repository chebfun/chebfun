function out = sum(f, dim)
%SUM   Definite integral of a BNDFUN on its interval [a,b]
%   S = SUM(F) is the integral from a to b of F.
%
%   If F is an array-valued BNDFUN then the result is a row vector containing
%   the definite integrals of each column.
%
%   SUM(F, 2) sums over the second dimension of F, i.e., adds up its columns. If
%   F is a scalar-valued BNDFUN, this simply returns F.
