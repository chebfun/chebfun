%COEFFS2VALS   Convert Chebyshev coefficients to values at Chebyshev points
%of the 2nd kind.
%   V = COEFFS2VALS(C) returns the values of the polynomial V(i,1) = P(x_i) =
%   C(1,1)*T_{0}(x_i) + ... + C(N,1)*T_{N-1}(x_i), where the x_i are
%   2nd-kind Chebyshev nodes.
%
%   If the input C is an (N+1)xM matrix then V = COEFFS2VALS(C) returns the
%   (N+1)xM matrix of values V such that V(i,j) = P_j(x_i) = C(1,j)*T_{0}(x_i)
%   + C(2,j)*T_{1}(x_i) + ... + C(N,j)*T_{N-1}(x_i).

% Get the length of the input:
n = size(coeffs, 1);

% Trivial case (constant or empty):
if ( n <= 1 )
    values = coeffs; 
    return
end

% Scale them by 1/2:
coeffs(2:n-1,:) = coeffs(2:n-1,:)/2;

% Mirror the coefficients (to fake a DCT using an FFT):
tmp = [ coeffs ; coeffs(n-1:-1:2,:) ];

if ( isreal(coeffs) )
    % Real-valued case:
    values = real(fft(tmp));
elseif ( isreal(1i*coeffs) )
    % Imaginary-valued case:
    values = 1i*real(fft(imag(tmp)));
else
    % General case:
    values = fft(tmp);
end

% Flip and truncate:
values = values(n:-1:1,:);
