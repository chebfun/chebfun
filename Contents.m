% Chebfun is an open-source software system for numerical computing with
% functions. The mathematical basis of Chebfun is piecewise polynomial
% interpolation implemented with what we call "Chebyshev technology". The
% foundations are described, with Chebfun examples, in the book Approximation
% Theory and Approximation Practice. Chebfun has extensive capabilities for
% dealing with linear and nonlinear differential and integral operators, and
% it also includes continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like QR and
% singular value decomposition. The Chebfun2 extension works with functions of
% two variables defined on a rectangle in the x-y plane. To get a sense of the
% breadth and power of Chebfun, a great place to start is by looking at our
% Examples.
