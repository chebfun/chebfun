function [pass, u1, u2, info1, info2] = test_scalarODE_sign(pref)
% A nonlinear CHEBOP test. This test tests a scalar ODE, where there is a
% breakpoint in the domain of the CHEBOP. Furthermore, the operator has a
% discontinuous coefficient, which will induce a further breakpoint in the
% solution. The problem is solved using chebcolloc1, chebcolloc2 and ultraS
% discretizations. The problem solved does not require damping for the Newton
% iteration to converge.

%% Setup
if ( nargin == 0 )
    pref = cheboppref;
end
dom = [-1 .5 1];

N = chebop(@(x,u) diff(u,2) + sign(x).*sin(u), dom);
N.lbc = @(u) u - 2;
N.rbc = @(u) u - 2;
rhs = 0;

%% Try different discretizations
% Start with chebcolloc2
pref.discretization = @chebcolloc2;
[u1, info1] = solveBVP(N, rhs, pref);

%% Change to ultraS
pref.discretization = @ultraS;
[u2, info2] = solveBVP(N, rhs, pref);

%% Change to chebcolloc1
pref.discretization = @chebcolloc1;

%% Did we pass? 
% To pass, both residuals have to be small, but we should not expect u1 and u2
% to be identical!
