function [pass, u1, u2, info1, info2] = test_scalarODE(pref)
% The basic nonlinear CHEBOP test. This test tests a simple scalar ODE, where no
% breakpoints occur. It solves the problem using chebcolloc1, chebcolloc2 and ultraS
% discretizations. The problem solved is simple enough that no damping is
% required.

%% Setup
dom = [0 pi];
if ( nargin == 0 )
    pref = cheboppref;
end

N = chebop(@(u) diff(u, 2) + sin(u - .2), dom);
N.lbc = @(u) u - 2; 
N.rbc = @(u) u - 3;
rhs = 0;

%% Try different discretizations
% Start with chebcolloc2
pref.discretization = @chebcolloc2;
[u1, info1] = solveBVP(N, rhs, pref);

%% Change to ultraS
pref.discretization = @ultraS;
[u2, info2] = solveBVP(N, rhs, pref);

%% Change to chebcolloc1
pref.discretization = @chebcolloc1;
[u3, info3] = solveBVP(N, rhs, pref);

%% Did we pass? 
% To pass, both residuals have to be small, but we should not expect u1 and u2
% to be identical!
tol = pref.errTol;
pass(1) = norm(N(u1)) < tol;
pass(2) = norm(N(u2)) < tol;
pass(3) = norm(N(u3)) < tol;
