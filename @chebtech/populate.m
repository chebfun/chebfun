function [f, values] = populate(f, op, vscale, hscale, pref)
%POPULATE   Populate a CHEBTECH class with values.
%   F = F.POPULATE(OP) returns a CHEBTECH representation populated with values
%   VALUES of the function OP evaluated on a Chebyshev grid. The fields
%   F.ISHAPPY and F.EPSLEVEL indicate whether the representation is deemed
%   'happy' and to what accuracy (see HAPPINESSCHECK.m). Essentially this means
%   that such an interpolant is a sufficiently accurate (i.e., to a relative
%   accuracy of F.EPSLEVEL) approximation to OP. If F.ISHAPPY is FALSE, then
%   POPULATE was not able to obtain a happy result.
%
%   OP should be vectorized (i.e., accept a vector input), and output a vector
%   of the same length. Furthermore, OP may be an array-valued function, in
%   which case it should accept a vector of length N and return a matrix of size
%   NxM.
%
%   F.POPULATE(OP, VSCALE, HSCALE) enforces that the happiness check is relative
%   to the initial vertical scale VSCALE and horizontal scale HSCALE. These
%   values default to 0 and 1 respectively. During refinement, VSCALE updates
%   itself to be the largest magnitude values to which (each of the columns in)
%   OP evaluated to.
%
%   F.POPULATE(OP, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF) enforces any additional preferences
%   specified in the preference structure PREF (see CHEBTECH.TECHPREF).
%
%   F.POPULATE(VALUES, ...) (or F.POPULATE({VALUES, COEFFS}, ...)) populates F
%   non-adaptively with the VALUES (and COEFFS) passed. These values are still
%   tested for happiness in the same way as described above, but the length of
%   the representation is not altered.

% The (adaptive) CHEBTECH construction process is as follows:
%
%    --->[REFINE]      [values, flag] = pref.refinementFunction(op, values, ...
%   |        |         pref). Allows refinements for: nested sampling, 
%   |        |         resampling, and composition (see REFINE.m & COMPOSE.m).
%   |        v
%   |  [update VSCALE] VSCALE should only be computed from _sampled_ values, 
%   |        |         not extrapolated ones.
%   |        v
%   |   [EXTRAPOLATE]  Remove NaNs/Infs and (optionally) extrapolate endpoints.
%   |        |
%   |        v
%   | [compute COEFFS] COEFFS = VALS2COEFFS(VALUES)
%   |        |

%    -<--[ISHAPPY?]    [ISHAPPY, EPSLEVEL, CUTOFF] = PREF.HAPPINESSCHECK(F, OP,
