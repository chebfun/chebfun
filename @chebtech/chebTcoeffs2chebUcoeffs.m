%CHEBTCOEFFS2CHEBUCOEFFS   Convert Chebyshev-T coeffs. to Chebyshev-U coeffs.
%   CU = CHEBTCOEFFS2CHEBUCOEFFS(CT) takes a column vector of coefficients of a
%   polynomial represented as an expansion in the Chebyshev polynomials of the
%   first kind T_k(x) (ordered starting with the coefficient of T_0(x)) and
%   returns the column vector of coefficients of the same polynomial expanded
%   in Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind U_k(x) (ordered starting with
%   the coefficient of U_0(x)).
%
%   If CT is a matrix, the conversion is performed column-wise.
