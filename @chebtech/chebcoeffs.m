function out = chebcoeffs(f, N)
%CHEBCOEFFS   Chebyshev polynomial coefficients of a CHEBTECH.
%   A = CHEBCOEFFS(F) returns the column vector of coefficients such that F =
%   A(1) T_0(x) + ... + A(N-1) T_{N-2}(x) + A(N) T_{N-1}(x), where T_k(x)
%   denotes the k-th Chebyshev polynomial and LENGTH(F) = N. This is equivalent
%   to GET(F, 'COEFFS').
%
%   If F is array-valued with P columns, then A is an NxP matrix.
%
%   A = CHEBCOEFFS(F, M) truncates or pads the vector A so that M coefficients
%   of the CHEBTECH F are returned.
%
%   If F is array-valued with P columns, then A is an MxP matrix.
