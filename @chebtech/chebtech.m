% CHEBTECH Class Description:
%
% The CHEBTECH class is an abstract class for representations of smooth
% functions on the interval [-1,1] via interpolated function values at Chebyshev
% points and coefficients of the corresponding first-kind Chebyshev series
% expansion.
%
% There are two concrete realizations of the CHEBTECH class--CHEBTECH1 and
% CHEBTECH2--which interpolate on Chebyshev grids of the 1st and 2nd kind,
% respectively.  Note that although they use different Chebyshev grids in
% 'value' space, their coefficients are always from an expansion in first-kind
% Chebyshev polynomials (i.e., those usually denoted by $T_k(x)$).
%
% The vertical scale VSCALE is used to enforce scale invariance in CHEBTECH
% construction and subsequent operations. For example, that
%   chebtech1(@(x) 2^300*f(x)) = 2^300*chebtech1(@(x) f(x)).
%
% VSCALE may be optionally passed to the constructor (if not, it defaults to 0),
% and during construction it is updated to be the maximum magnitude of the
% sampled function values. Similarly the horizontal scale HSCALE is used to
% enforce scale invariance when the input OP has been implicitly mapped from a
% domain other than [-1 1] before being passed to a CHEBTECH constructor.
%
% EPSLEVEL is the happiness level to which the CHEBTECH was constructed (See
% HAPPINESSCHECK.m for full documentation) or a rough accuracy estimate of
% subsequent operations, both relative to VSCALE. Therefore EPSLEVEL could be
% regarded as the number of correct digits in the sampled value that created
% VSCALE.
%
% Here is a rough guide to how scale and accuracy information is propagated in
% subsequent operations after construction:
%   h = f + c:
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel*f.vscale + eps(c)) / h.vscale;
%
%   h = f * c:
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h) = abs(c)*f.vscale;
%     h.epslevel = f.epslevel + eps(c)/c;
%
%   h = f + g:
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel*f.vscale + g.epslevel*g.vscale) / h.vscale
%
%   h = f .* g:
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h);
%     h.epslevel = (f.epslevel + g.epslevel) * (f.vscale*g.vscale)/h.vscale
%
%   h = diff(f):
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h);
%     % [TODO]: Figure this out rigourously.
%     h.epslevel = n*log(n)*f.epslevel*f.vscale; % *(h.vscale/h.vscale)
%     % Note we don't divide by h.vscale here as we must also multiply by it.
%
%   h = cumsum(f):
%     h.vscale = getvscl(h);
%     % [TODO]: Figure this out rigourously.
%     h.epslevel = 2*f.epslevel*f.vscale/h.vscale
%
% If the input operator OP in a call to a concrete CHEBTECH constructor, say,
% CHEBTECH1(OP), evaluates to NaN or Inf at any of the sample points used by the
% constructor, then a suitable replacement is found by extrapolating (globally)
% from the numeric values (see EXTRAPOLATE.M). If the EXTRAPOLATE preference is
% set to TRUE (See CHEBTECH.TECHPREF), then the endpoint values -1 and +1 are
% always extrapolated (i.e., regardless of whether they evaluate to NaN).
%
% The CHEBTECH classes support the representation of array-valued functions (for
% example, f = chebtech1(@(x) [sin(x), cos(x)])). In such cases, the values and
% coefficients are stored in a matrix (column-wise), and as such each component
% of the array-valued function is truncated to the same length, even if the
% demands of 'happiness' imply that one of the components could be truncated to
% a shorter length than the others. All CHEBTECH methods should accept such
% array-valued forms. Note that this representation is distinct from an array of
% CHEBTECH objects, for which there is little to no support.
