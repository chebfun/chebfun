function b = legpoly(f)
%LEGPOLY   Compute Legendre series coefficients of a CHEBTECH object.
%   B = LEGPOLY(F) returns the Legendre series coefficients of CHEBTECH F, so
%   that F = B(N+1)*P_N + ... + B(1)*P_0, where P_k is the kth Legendre
%   polynomial.
%
%   If F is an array-valued CHEBETCH, then a matrix of coefficients is returned
%   so that F(:,k) = B(N+1,k)*P_N + ... + B(1,k)*P_0.

% This is currently implemented by 'inverting' the Vandermonde-type matrix. In
% fact the matrix can be inverted explicitly by noting that D*P'W*P = I, where
% P is the Legendre-Vandemonde matrix evaluated on a Chebyshev grid of size
% 2*n+1, W is a diagonal matrix of the corresponding Clenshaw-Curtis weights,
% and the matrix D is the diagonal scaling ((0:n)'+1/2);
%
% In theory, the O(N^2) coefficient-based bethod due to Piessens [1] should be
% faster (i.e., have a smaller implied constant), but the tight FOR loop is
% prohibitively slow in MATLAB.

% [TODO]: Perhaps it's better to evaluate on a Legendre grid? Then there's no
% need to make P have double the length, however you do have to evaluate f on a
% Legendre grid (for which the weights would also need to be computed).
%    
% [TODO]: Develop a fast algorithm for this transformation.

n = size(f, 1) - 1;

% Create a Chebyshev grid of double the length:
x = f.chebpts(2*n + 1);
w = f.quadwts(2*n + 1);

% Evaluate the function on this grid (using FFTs):
v = get(prolong(f, 2*n + 1), 'values');

% Initialise the Vandermonde-like recurrence:
V = zeros(length(x), n);
Pm2 = 1; 
Pm1 = x;
V(:,1:2) = [(1 + 0*x), x];
for k = 1:n-1
    % Legendre polynomial recurrence:
    P = ((2*k + 1)*Pm1.*x - k*Pm2) / (k + 1);
    Pm2 = Pm1; 
    Pm1 = P; 
    % Store in a matrix:
    V(:,2+k) = P;
end

% Use weighted discrete orthogonality to invert the system (see doc above):
% b = ((0:n)'+1/2).*(V'*(w'.*v)); % b = (V\v) (works for scalar v)

% For array-valued CHEBTECH objects we need to use BSXFUN():
b = bsxfun(@times, (0:n)' + 0.5, V'*bsxfun(@times, w', v)); % b = (V\v)

end

%% Piessens' method [1] is much slower in MATLAB because of the tight FOR loops.

% % Initialise the output vector:

% % The first entry is different:
% % Make the diagonal entries of the conversion matrix:
% d = [1 ; 2/3 ; zeros(n-2, 1)];

%     % Initialise e to the diagonal entry:
%     e = d(j+1);
%     % Loops along entries in the jth row:
