%HAPPINESSCHECK   Happiness test for a CHEBTECH
%   [ISHAPPY, EPSLEVEL, CUTOFF] = HAPPINESSCHECK(F, OP, VALUES) tests if the 
%   CHEBTECH with values VALUES and coefficients F.COEFFS would be a 'happy'
%   approximation (in the sense defined below and relative to F.VSCALE and
%   F.HSCALE) to the function handle OP. If the approximation is happy, the
%   output ISHAPPY is TRUE, the happiness level is returned in EPSLEVEL,
%   and CUTOFF indicates the point to which the coefficients COEFFS may be
%   truncated. Even if ISHAPPY is FALSE, the attempted happiness level is still
%   returned in EPSLEVEL (i.e., we attempted to be happy at EPSLEVEL but failed)
%   and CUTOFF is returned as size(F.COEFFS, 1).
%
%   HAPPINESSCHECK(F) computes VALUES used above from F.COEFFS2VALS(F.COEFFS).
%
%   HAPPINESSCHECK(F, OP, VALUES, PREF) allows different preferences to be used; in
%   particular PREF.EPS sets the target tolerance for happiness.
%
%   Furthermore, alternative definitions of happiness can be chosen by setting
%   the PREF.HAPPINESSCHECK field. This field may be one of the built in
%   checks: 'CLASSIC', 'STRICT', 'LOOSE', or a function handle pointing to a
%   function with the template [ISHAPPY, EPSLEVEL, CUTOFF] = @(F, PREF). The
%   built in checks are:
%      CLASSIC: Chooses an EPSLEVEL based upon the length on the 'tail' and a
%               finite difference gradient approximation.
%      STRICT : The tail _must_ be below that specified by PREF.EPS.
%      LOOSE  : To be specified.
%   Further details of these happiness checks are given in their corresponding
%   m-files.
%
%   Regardless of the happiness definition, HAPPINESSCHECK also performs a
%   SAMPLETEST unless PREF.SAMPLETEST is FALSE or OP is empty.
