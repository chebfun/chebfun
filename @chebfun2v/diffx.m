function G = diffx( F, n )
%DIFFX   Differentiate a CHEBFUN2V with respect to its first argument.
% 	DIFFX(F) returns a CHEBFUN2V representing the derivative of F in its
%   first argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,1,2).
%
% 	DIFFX(F,N) returns a CHEBFUN2V representing the Nth derivative of F in
%   its first argument. This is the same as DIFF(F,N,2).
%
%   This command is for convenience as the syntax for DIFF, inherited from the
%   DIFF command for matrices, can be confusing.
%
