% Quadrature weights for Chebyshev points of 1st kind (also known as Fejer nodes
% of the 1st kind): cos(k*pi/n), where k = 1/2,3/2,...,n-1/2 (see references
% [1,2]).

if ( n == 1 )                   % Special case (single point)
    w = 2;

    L = 0:n-1;
    r = 2./(1-4*min(L,n-L).^2); % auxiliary vector
    s1 = sign(n/2-L);           % auxiliary vector
    v1 = s1.*r.*exp(1i*pi/n*L);
    w = real(ifft(v1));         % Chebyshev or Fejer-1 weights
