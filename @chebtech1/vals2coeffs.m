function coeffs = vals2coeffs(values)
%VALS2COEFFS   Convert values at Chebyshev points to Chebyshev coefficients.
%   C = VALS2COEFFS(V) returns the (N+1)x1 vector of coefficients such that
%   F(x) = C(1)*T_N(x) + ... + C(N)*T_1(x) + C(N+1)*T_0(x) (where T_k(x)
%   denotes the k-th 1st-kind Chebyshev polynomial) interpolates the data
%   [V(1) ; ... ; V(N+1)] at Chebyshev points of the 1st kind. 
%
%   If the input V is an (N+1)xM matrix, then C = VALS2COEFFS(V) returns the
%   (N+1)xM matrix of coefficients C such that F_j(x) = C(1,j)*T_N(x) + ... 
%   + C(N,j)*T_1(x) + C(N+1)*T_0(x) interpolates [V(1,j) ; ... ; V(N+1,j)]
%   for j = 1:M.
