classdef chebtech1 < chebtech
%CHEBTECH1   Approximate smooth functions on [-1,1] with Chebyshev interpolants.
%
%   Class for approximating smooth functions on the interval [-1,1]
%   using function values at 1st-kind Chebyshev points and coefficients of the
%   corresponding 1st-kind Chebyshev series expansion.
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   CHEBTECH1(OP) constructs a CHEBTECH1 object from the function handle OP. OP
%   should be vectorized (i.e., accept a vector input) and ouput a vector of
%   the same length. CHEBTECH1 objects allow for array-valued construction
%   (i.e., of array-valued function), in which case OP should accept a vector
%   of length N and return a matrix of size NxM, where M is number of columns
%   of the multi -valued function.
%
%   CHEBTECH1(OP, DATA) constructs a CHEBTECH2 using the additional data
%   supplied in the DATA structure.  Fields currently recognized are:
%     DATA.VSCALE    (Default:  0)
%     DATA.HSCALE    (Default:  1)
%         The constructor builds a CHEBTECH1 with 'happiness' (see
%         HAPPINESSCHECK.m) relative to the maximum of the given vertical scale
%         DATA.VSCALE and the (column-wise) infinity norm of the sampled
%         function values of OP, and the fixed horizontal scale DATA.HSCALE.
%   If any fields in DATA are empty or not supplied, or if DATA itself is empty
%   or not supplied, appropriate default values are set.
%
%   CHEBTECH1(OP, DATA, PREF) overrides the default behavior with that given by
%   the preference structure PREF.
%
%   CHEBTECH1(VALUES, ...) returns a CHEBTECH1 object which interpolates the
%   values in the columns of VALUES at 1st-kind Chebyshev points and
%   CHEBTECH1({VALUES, COEFFS}, ... ) uses the Chebyshev coefficients passed in
%   COEFFS rather than computing them. If COEFFS are passed, the resulting
%   CHEBTECH1 is always deemed 'happy'.
%
% Examples: % Basic construction: f = chebtech1(@(x) sin(x))
%
%   % Construction with preferences:
%   p.sampleTest = 0; % See CHEBTECH.TECHPREF for details
%   f = chebtech1(@(x) sin(x), [], [], p)
%
%   % Array-valued construction:
%   f = chebtech1(@(x) [sin(x), cos(x), exp(x)])

% CHEBTECH1 Class Description:
%
% The CHEBTECH1 class represents smooth functions on the interval [-1,1] using
% function values at 1st-kind Chebyshev points and coefficients of the
% corresponding 1st-kind Chebyshev series expansion.
%
% The constructor is supplied with a handle that evaluates a given function on
% an increasingly fine Chebyshev 1st-kind grid (see REFINE.m) until the
% representation is deemed 'happy' (see HAPPINESSCHECK). The resulting
% object can be used to evaluate and operate on the input function.
%
% More information can be found in the CHEBTECH class definition.
