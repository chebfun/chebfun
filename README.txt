Chebfun is a collection of algorithms and an open-source software system in
object-oriented MATLAB which extends familiar powerful methods of numerical
computation involving numbers to continuous or piecewise-continuous functions.
It also implements continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like the QR
decomposition and the SVD, and solves ordinary differential equations. The
mathematical basis of the system combines tools of Chebyshev expansions, fast
Fourier transform, barycentric interpolation, recursive zerofinding, and
automatic differentiation.
