function Q = cumsummat(N)
% CUMSUMMAT  Chebyshev integration matrix.
% Q = CUMSUMMAT(N) is the matrix that maps function values at N Chebyshev
% points to values of the integral of the interpolating polynomial at
% those points, with the convention that the first value is zero.

% TODO: This method is also used in the methods JACPTS and LEGPTS. It should
% probably be made a static method of CHEBTECH (or its subclasses). Thus, it has
% not been reviewed as a part of the LINOP code review. AB, 30/01/14.


% TODO: More efficient implementation?
