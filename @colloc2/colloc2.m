classdef colloc2 < chebDiscretization
%COLLOC2   Collocation based on 2nd-kind Chebyshev points.
%   COLLOC2 is an implementation of CHEBDISCRETIZATION that applies spectral
%   collocation using 2nd kind Chebyshev points for differential and integral
%   operators and systems. 
%
%   The default discretization type to use is set by CHEBOPPREF. You can also
%   use CHEBOPPREF to create a preferences object and change its
%   'discretization' property. 
%
%   Linear algebra operations with COLLOC2 operators generally take O(N^3)
%   flops, where in most contexts N is determined automatically to resolve the
%   solution. The allowed values of N are governed by the 'dimensionValues'
%   property in CHEBOPPREF. You can also set the maximum N (including systems
%   and piecewise definitions) through the 'maxTotalLength' property.
%
