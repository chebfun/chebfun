function varargout = length(varargin)
%LENGTH  The rank of a SPHEREFUN2.
%   K = LENGTH(F) returns the rank of the SPHEREFUN2 representation.
%
%   [M, N] = LENGTH( F ) returns the length of the column and 
%   row slices employed in the separable model.  The interpretation 
%   of this quantity depends on the underlying representation.
