classdef spherefun < separableApprox
%SPHEREFUN class for representing functions on the unit sphere.
% 
%   Class for approximating functions defined on the unit sphere. The 
%   functions should be smooth.
%
% SPHEREFUN(F) constructs a SPHEREFUN object representing the function F on
% the unit sphere. F can have the following form:
%    1. A function handle in (x,y,z), e.g., @(x,y,z) x.*y.*z + cos(x).
%    2. A function handle in spherical coordinates (lambda,theta), where
%       lambda is the azimuthal variable and satisfies -pi <= lambda <= pi
%       and theta is the polar angle and satisfies 0 <= theta < pi,
%       e.g., @(lambda,theta) cos(cos(lambda).*sin(theta))
%    3. A matrix of numbers. 
% If F is a function handle then it should allow for vectorized evaluations.
%
% If F is a matrix, F = (f_ij), the numbers fij are used as function values
% at tensor equally-spaced points in the intrinsic spherical coordinate 
% system, i.e., [-pi,pi]x[0,pi].
%
% SPHEREFUN(F, k) returns a rank k approximation to F.
%
% SPHEREFUN(F, [m n]) returns a representation of F using a degree m
% trigonometric approximation of F in the theta (polar) direction and a
% degree n trigonometric approximation in the lambda (azimuthal) direction.
% The result is compressed in low rank form and the rank k is still
% determined adaptively (satisfying k<=min(m,n)+1).
% 
% The SPHEREFUN software system is based on:

% A. Townsend, H. Wilber, and G. Wright, Computing with functions in
% spherical and polar geometries I: The sphere, SIAM. J. Sci. Comput., 38-4
