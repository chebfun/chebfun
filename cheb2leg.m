%CHEB2LEG   Convert Chebyshev coefficients to Legendre coefficients. 
%   C_LEG = CHEB2LEG(C_CHEB) converts the vector C_CHEB of Chebyshev
%   coefficients to a vector C_LEG of Legendre coefficients such that
%       C_CHEB(1)*T0 + ... + C_CHEB(N)*T{N-1} = ...
%           C_LEG(1)*P0 + ... + C_LEG(N)*P{N-1},
%   where P{k} is the degree k Legendre polynomial normalized so that
%   max(|P{k}|) = 1.
% 
%   C_LEG = CHEB2LEG(C_CHEB, 'norm') is as above, but with the Legendre
%   polynomials normalized to be orthonormal.
%
%   If C_CHEB is a matrix then the CHEB2LEG operation is applied to each column.
