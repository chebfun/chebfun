function pass = domainCheck(f, g)
%DOMAINCHECK   True if the domains of two CHEBFUN objects are the same.
%   DOMAINCHECK(F, G) returns TRUE if the endpoints of the domains of the two
%   CHEBFUNs F and G coincide up to a tolerance depending on their horizontal
%   scales or if both F and G are empty CHEBFUN objects.
