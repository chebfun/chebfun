function [A, B] = domain(f)
%DOMAIN   Domain of definition of a CHEBFUN.
%   I = DOMAIN(F) returns a row vector representing the domain of definition
%   (including breakpoints) of the CHEBFUN F, and is equivalent to F.domain.
% 
%   [A, B] = DOMAIN(F) returns the endpoints of the domain as scalars.
