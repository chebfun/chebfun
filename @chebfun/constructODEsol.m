%CONSTRUCTODESOL   Call one of Matlab's ODE solvers and return a CHEBFUN
%   Y = CHEBFUN.CONSTRUCTODESOL(SOLVER, ODEFUN, D, ...) calls one of the the
%   built-in MATLAB methods SOLVER to solve an initial-value problem on the
%   domain D. The result is then converted to a piecewise-defined CHEBFUN with
%   one column per solution component.
%
%   CHEBFUN.CONSTRUCTODESOL has the same calling sequence as Matlab's standard
%   odesolvers (ode113, ode15s, ode45) following the first argument.
%
%   One can also write [T, Y] = CONSTRUCTODESOL(...), in which case T is a
%   linear CHEBFUN on the domain D.
%
%   It is possible to pass a MATLAB ODESET struct to this method for specifying
%   options. The CHEBFUN overloads of the MATLAB ODE methods allow an extra
%   option, 'restartSolver', which if set to TRUE, will restart the ODE solver
%   at every breakpoint encountered. This is the default behaviour
