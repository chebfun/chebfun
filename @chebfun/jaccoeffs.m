function out = jaccoeffs(f, n, a, b)
%LEGPOLY   Jacobi polynomial coefficients of a CHEBFUN.
%   A = JACCOEFFS(F, N, ALPHA, BETA) returns the first N+1 coefficients in the
%   Jacobi series expansion of the CHEBFUN F, so that such that F approximately
%   equals A(1) J_N(x) + ... + A(N) J_1(x) + A(N+1) J_0(x) where J_N(x) denotes
%   the N-th Jacobi polynomial with parameters ALPHA and BETA. A is a row
%   vector.
%
%   If F is smooth (i.e., numel(f.funs) == 1), then A = JACCOEFFS(F, ALPHA,
%   BETA) will assume that N = length(F) - 1;
%
%   There is also a JACCOEFFS command in the Chebfun root directory which
%   computes the CHEBFUN corresponding to the Jacobi polynomial J_n(x, ALPHA,
%   BETA). Both versions of JACCOEFFS use the same normalization.
%
%   JACCOEFFS does not support quasimatrices.
