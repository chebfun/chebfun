function varargout = ode15s(varargin)
%ODE15S   Solve stiff differential equations and DAEs. Output a CHEBFUN.
%   Y = CHEBFUN.ODE15S(ODEFUN, D, ...) applies the standard ODE15S method to
%   solve an initial-value problem on the domain D. The result is then converted
%   to a piecewise-defined CHEBFUN with one column per solution component.
%
%   CHEBFUN.ODE15S has the same calling sequence as Matlab's standard ODE15S. 
%
%   One can also write [T, Y] = ODE15S(...), in which case T is a linear CHEBFUN
%   on the domain D.
%
% Example:
%   y = chebfun.ode15s(@vdp1000, [0, 3000], [2 ; 0]); % Solve Van der Pol problem
%   roots(y(:,1) - 1);                                % Find when y = 1

% Call the built in ODE15S():
sol = ode15s(varargin{:});

% Convert solution to a CHEBFUN:
[t, y] = chebfun.odesol(sol); 

% Output in a consistent way with the built in routine:
if ( nargout == 1 )
    % Only y will be returned in this case.
    varargout = {y};
else
    varargout = {t, y};
end
