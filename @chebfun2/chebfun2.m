classdef chebfun2 < separableApprox
%CHEBFUN2   CHEBFUN2 class for representing functions on [a,b]x[c,d].
% 
%   Class for approximating functions defined on finite rectangles. The 
%   functions should be smooth.
%
% CHEBFUN2(F) constructs a CHEBFUN2 object representing the function F on
% [-1,1]x[-1 1]. F can be a string, e.g., 'sin(x.*y)', a function handle, e.g.,
% @(x,y) x.*y + cos(x), or a matrix of numbers. For the first two, F should in
% most cases be "vectorized" in the sense that it may be evaluated at a matrix
% of points and returns a matrix output. 
%
% CHEBFUN2(F, [A B C D]) specifies a rectangle [A B]x[C D] where the 
% function is defined. A, B, C, D must all be finite.
%
% If F is a matrix, A = (a_ij), the numbers aij are used as function values
% at tensor Chebyshev points of the 2nd kind.
% 
% CHEBFUN2(F, k) returns a rank k approximation to F.
%
% CHEBFUN2(F, [m n]) returns a representation of a bivariate polynomial
% with m coefficients in x and n coefficients in y. The polynomial is
% compressed in low rank form and the rank k is still determined adaptively
% (satisfying k<=min(m,n)+1).
%
% CHEBFUN2(F, k, [A B C D]) or CHEBFUN2(F, [m,n], [A B C D]) is nonadaptive in
% rank or degrees, as above, returning a chebfun2 on the domain [A B]x[C D]. 
% 
% CHEBFUN2(F, 'coeffs') where F is matrix uses the matrix as coefficients in 
% a Chebyshev tensor expansion.
%
% The Chebfun2 software system is based on: 
%
% A. Townsend and L. N. Trefethen, An extension of Chebfun to two dimensions,
% SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35 (2013), C495-C518.
