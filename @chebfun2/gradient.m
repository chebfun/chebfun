function varargout = gradient( f ) 
%GRADIENT  Numerical gradient of a CHEBFUN2. 
%   [FX FY] = GRADIENT(F) returns the numerical gradient of the CHEBFUN2 F,
%   where FX is the derivative of F in the x direction and FY is the derivative
%   of F in the y direction. Both derivatives are returned as CHEBFUN2 objects.
%
%   G = GRADIENT(F) returns a CHEBFUN2V which represents
% 
%            G = ( F_x ; F_y )
%
