function varargout = chebpoly2( f )
%CHEBPOLY2  bivariate Chebyshev coefficients
%   X = CHEBPOLY2(F) returns the matrix of bivariate coefficients such that F =
%   sum_i ( sum_j Y(i,j) T_i(y) T_j(x) ), where Y = rot90(X, 2). It is MATLAB
%   convention to flip the coefficients in this silly way.
%
%   [A, D, B] = CHEBPOLY2( f ) returns the same coefficients keeping them in low
%   rank form, i.e., X = A * D * B'.
