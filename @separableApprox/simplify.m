function f = simplify(f, tol)
% Simplify a SEPARABLEAPPROX
% 
% F = SIMPLIFY( F ) compressed the representation of F to one that is
% numerically the same, but requires fewer parameters to store. Currently this
% simplifies the polynomial degree of F, but not the rank. 
%
% F = SIMPLIFY(F, TOL) does the same as above but uses the scalar TOL instead
% of the default simplification tolerance as the relative threshold level.

    tol = [];

% Note that we do not simplify the rank here because that would require 
% calling the constructor and is expensive.  In almost all situations we 
% are happy with simplifying the columns and rows only. 

% Simplify the column and row slices. 
f.cols = simplify( f.cols, tol, 'globaltol' ); 
f.rows = simplify( f.rows, tol, 'globaltol' ); 

% Ensure the left and right limits match the endpoints:
f.cols = resetPointValues(f.cols);
f.rows = resetPointValues(f.rows);
