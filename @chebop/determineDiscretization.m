%DETERMINEDISCRETIZATION    Determine discretization for a CHEBOP object with 
%                           periodic boundary conditions.
%
%   PREFOUT = DETERMINEDISCRETIZATION(N, L, ISPREFGIVEN, PREFIN) choses the
%   correct discretization PREFOUT.DISCRETIZATION to be used when solving
%   problems with periodic boundary conditions (BVP/EIGS/EXPM), modeled by a
%   CHEBOP N and a LINOP L.

% Check whether the user passed a CHEBOPPREF object PREF with
% PREF.DISCRETIZATION set to TRIGCOLLOC, or TRIGCOLLOC is the default
% discretization.
%
% Since TRIGCOLLOC does not support breakpoints, we need to throw an error if
% breakpoints are present. Note that here and below, we look at L.domain rather
% than N.domain, as the domain of the LINOP L will also include any breakpoints
% arising from discontinuous coefficients of N (which we only become aware of
% when we do the linearization).

% If the boundary conditions are periodic, change the discretization to 
% TRIGCOLLOC, unless one (or more) of the following applies:
% - The user passed a PREF object.
% - The default discretization is ULTRAS.
% - Breakpoint(s) are present.
