function [L, res, isLinear] = linearize(N, u, x, flag)
%LINEARIZE    Linearize a CHEBOP.
%   L = LINEARIZE(N) returns a LINOP that corresponds to linearising the CHEBOP
%   N around the zero function on N.DOMAIN. The linop L will both include the
%   linearised differential equation, as well as linearised boundary conditions
%   (from N.LBC and N.RBC) and other constraints (from N.BC).
%
%   L = LINEARIZE(N, U) linearizes the CHEBOP N around the function U. Here, U
%   can either be a CHEBFUN or a CHEBMATRIX. IF U = [] then N is linearized
%   around the zero function, as above.
%
%   L = LINEARIZE(N, U, X) passes the independent variable, X, on N.DOMAIN.
%   If X = [] then LINEARIZE constructs the variable itself internally.
%
%   L = LINEARIZE(N, U, X, FLAG) is useful when we call LINOP(CHEBOP), i.e.,
%   converting a linear CHEBOP to a LINOP. If FLAG = 1, the method will stop
%   execution and return as soon as it encounters a nonlinear field in N. In
%   this case L is returned as an empty LINOP.
%
%   [L, RES] = LINEARIZE(N, ...) also returns RES; to the residual of the
%   differential equation part of N at the function it was linearized. In other
%   words, RES is the result of evaluating N at the zero function if no
%   additioanl function is passed to LINEARIZE(), or the function U if it is
%   passed. If N.OP is a scalar equation, RES is a CHEBFUN, otherwise it is a
%   CHEBMATRIX.
%
%   [L, RES, ISLINEAR] = LINEARIZE(N, ...) also returns the vector ISLINEAR,
%   with entries as follows:
%       ISLINEAR(1) = 1 if N.OP is linear, 0 otherwise.
%       ISLINEAR(2) = 1 if N.LBC is linear, 0 otherwise.
%       ISLINEAR(3) = 1 if N.RBC is linear, 0 otherwise.
%       ISLINEAR(4) = 1 if N.BC is linear, 0 otherwise.

% Start by assuming that N is linear.

% Support single input argument for autonomous scalar problems:
if ( nargin(N) == 1 )
    N.op = @(x, u) N.op(u);
end

% Number of unknown variables N acts on. Subtract 1 from nargin(N.op), since the
% first argument is the independent variable x.
numVars = nargin(N.op) - 1;
dom = N.domain;

%% Construct a suitable function to linearize about:

% Construct the zero function on N.DOMAIN to linearize around if no U was
% passed.
if ( nargin < 2 || isempty(u) )
    % Initialise a zero CHEBFUN:
    zeroFun = chebfun(0, dom);
    % Wrap in a cell and call repmat() to get correct dimensions
    u = repmat({zeroFun}, numVars, 1);
end

% Construct the independent variable X if needed.
if ( nargin < 3 || isempty(x) )
    x = chebfun(@(x) x, dom);
end

% By default, set FLAG to 0.
if ( nargin < 4 || isempty(flag) )
    flag = 0;
end

% Convert the linerization variable to cell=-array form so that we can create
% and seed ADCHEBFUN objects:

% Convert each CHEBFUN object in the cell-array U to an ADCHEBFUN, and seed the
% derivative so it'll be of correct dimensions (i.e. correct block-size).
for k = 1:numVars
    u{k} = seed(adchebfun(u{k}, N.domain), k, numVars);
end

% Evaluate N.op. The output will be the ADCHEBFUN NU. In case of systems, NU
% will be an array-valued ADCHEBFUN.

% Construct the residual by vertically concatenating all functions stored in NU.
% RES will be a CHEBMATRIX.
res = vertcat(get(Nu, 'func'));

% Linearity information:
isLinear(1) = all(all(vertcat(get(Nu, 'linearity'))));
