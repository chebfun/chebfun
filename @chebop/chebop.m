%CHEBOP  CHEBOP class for representing operators on functions defined on [a,b].
%
% N = CHEBOP(OP) creates a CHEBOP object N with operator defined by OP, which
% should be a handle to a function (often created using an anonymous function)
% that accepts a CHEBFUN or a CHEBMATRIX consisting of CHEBFUNs and scalars as
% input and returns a CHEBFUN (or CHEBMATRIX). The first input argument to OP is
% the independent variable X, while all others represent dependent functions of
% X; if only one input argument is accepted by OP, it is the dependent variable.
% In case of coupled systems, the function OP must return vertically, not
% horizontally, concatenated elements. Note, this differs from the V4 syntax.
%
% Examples of N.OP:
%
%   One dependent variable:
%       @(x, u) x.*diff(u) + u;
%   No explicit independent variable:
%       @(u) diff(u,2) - exp(u);
%   Three dependent variables:
%       @(x, u, v, w) [ u.*diff(v) ; diff(u, 2) + w; diff(w) - v ];
%   Three dependent variables, CHEBMATRIX syntax:
%       @(x, u) [ u{1}.*diff(u{2}) ; diff(u{1}, 2) + u{3}; diff(u{3}) - u{2} ];
%   Function handle to a function defined in an .m-file:
%       @myOperator
%
% Note that when N.OP has two or more input arguments, the first one _MUST_ be
% the independent variable. When N.OP is specified as a function handle to a
% method specified in an .m-file, like in the last example above, and that
% function uses the CHEBMATRIX notation, e.g. diff(u{1}) + u{2}), it is
% necessary to either pass an initial guess to the operator via N.INIT (see
% below), or specify the number of variables that the operator operates on via
% N.NUMVARS.
%
% The number of elements in the output CHEBMATRIX should typically equal the
% number of dependent variables, whether specified as names or CHEBMATRIX
% elements (see section on parameter-dependent problems below).
%
% For scalar problems, it is possible to specify the OP of a CHEBOP with a
% string, where a backtick (`) is used to denote a derivative. The two scalar
% problems above could thus be specified as
%
%       N.op = 'x*u` + u'
%       N.op = 'u`` - exp(u)'
%
% Internally, CHEBOP will convert the string expressions to the corresponding
% anonymous function.
%
% By default, the operator acts on CHEBFUN objects defined on the domain [-1,1].
% CHEBOP(OP, D), for a vector D, gives a different domain, with breakpoints (if
% any) described by D.
%
% %% BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: %%
%
% CHEBOP(OP, D, LBC, RBC) specifies boundary conditions for functions at the
% left and right endpoints of the domain D. Possible values for LBC and RBC are:
%
%   []          : No condition (for only assigning LBC or RBC in constructor).
%   vector      : Only supported in the scalar case, and for first order
%                 coupled systems (i.e. no support for higher order coupled
%                 systems). 
%                   * In the scalar case, the value of the solution is given by
%                     the first entry of the vector, the value of its first
%                     derivative by the second entry, etc. E.g. for a second
%                     order problem on [0,1], N.lbc = [1;3] specifies
%                         u(0) = 1, u'(0) = 3.
%                   * In the system case, the value of the first unknown
%                     function at the endpoint is given by the first entry of
%                     the vector, the value of the second unknown function by
%                     the second entry of the vector, etc. E.g. for a system
%                     with two unknown functions on [0,1], N.lbc = [1;3]
%                     specifies
%                         u(0) = 1, v(0) = 1.
%   'dirichlet' : All variables equal zero.
%   'neumann'   : All variables have derivative zero.
%   function    : A function handle that must accept all dependent variables as
%                 given in OP and return a CHEBFUN or CHEBMATRIX. All elements
%                 of the result are evaluated at the endpoint, and for the
%                 solution of the BVP, they are made to equal zero.
% 
% A boundary condition function may be nonlinear; it must not accept the
% independent variable X as an input. Again, in case of systems, the function
% describing the boundary conditions must return vertically concatenated
% elements (again, differing from V4 syntax).
%
% Examples of how boundary conditions can be specified:
%
%   N.lbc = 0;                         % Set u = 0 at the left endpoint
%   N.rbc = 'neumann'                  % Set u' = 0 at the right endpoint
%   N.lbc = [1; 3; 2];                 % Set u = 1, u' = 3, u'' = 2 at left end
%   N.lbc = @(u) diff(u) - 2;          % set u' = 2 at the left endpoint
%   N.lbc = @(u, v, w) [ u - 1 ; w ];  % set u = 1 and w = 0 at the endpoint
%   N.lbc = @(u) [u{1} - 1; u{3}];     % Same as above, using CHEBMATRIX syntax.
%   N.rbc = @(u, v, w) u.*v - diff(w); % set u*v = w' at the right endpoint
%
% CHEBOP(OP, D, BC) gives boundary or other side conditions in an alternate
% form. Choices for BC are:
%
%   vector      : Only supported in the scalar case. The value of the solution 
%                 at both endpoints is given by the first entry of the vector,
%                 the value of its first derivative by the second entry, etc.
%   'dirichlet' : All variables equal zero at both endpoints.
%   'neumann'   : All variables have derivative zero at both endpoints.
%   'periodic'  : Impose periodicity on all dependent variables.
%   function    : See below.
%
% Note that the 'dirichlet' and 'neumann' keywords impose behavior that may not
% be identical to the common understanding of Dirichlet or Neumann conditions in
% every problem. When BC is passed in the CHEBOP call, the more specialized
% fields LBC and RBC are ignored. Furthermore, note that CHEBOP(OP, DOM, 0) is
% not equivalent to CHEBOP(OP, DOM, 0, []).
%
% If BC is given a function handle, then each condition must give points
% explicitly or otherwise evaluate to a scalar. The function handle must return
% a column vector, not a row vector. Example:
%   @(x, u) [ u(1) - u(0) ; sum(x.*u) ] % set u(1) = u(0), and integral
%                                       % of x.*u over the whole interval = 0.
%
% Boundary conditions may also be assigned to the CHEBOP N after it has been
% constructed, by N.lbc = ..., N.rbc = ..., and N.bc = ... . This will overwrite
% the conditions currently stored in the field being assigned to, but not the
% other fields, with an exception of keywords as noted below).
%
% CHEBOP(OP, ..., 'init', U) provides a CHEBFUN/CHEBMATRIX as a starting point
% for nonlinear iterations or a PDE solution. See CHEBOP/SOLVEBVP and
% CHEBOP/PDE15S for details.
%
% Note that many fields can be set after the CHEBOP object N is created: N.op,
% N.lbc, N.rbc, N.bc, N.init can all be assigned new values. Setting N.bc to any
% of 'dirichlet', 'neumann', or 'periodic', removes pre-existing entries in
% N.lbc, N.rbc, and N.bc.
%
% Example (second order BVP):
%
%   N = chebop(-5, 5);  % Constructs an empty CHEBOP on the interval [-5,5]
%   N.op = @(x, u) 0.01*diff(u, 2) - x.*u;
%   N.bc = 'dirichlet';
%   plot(N\1)
%
% Example (Lotka-Volterra, first order coupled IVP):
%   N = chebop(@(t,u,v) [diff(u)-2.*u+u.*v; diff(v)+v-u.*v], [0 20]);
%   N.lbc = @(u,v) [u - 0.5; v - 1]; % Initial populations
%   [u, v] = N\0;
%   plot([u, v], 'linewidth', 2)
%
%
% %% INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS %%
%
% When solving boundary-value problems, where conditions on the operator are
% imposed at both endpoints of the domain, CHEBOP will apply global spectral
% methods for solving the linear systems arising. In case of initial or final
% value problems (IVPs/FVPs), where all the conditions are imposed on the left
% endpoint of the domain, this often proves to be an inefficient way of solving
% the problems. If conditions are only imposed on one of the fields N.LBC or
% N.RBC, and not on N.BC, CHEBOP will automatically reformulate the problem so
% that it can be solved using one of MATLAB's build-in solvers ODE113, ODE15s or
% ODE45. See the help text in CHEBOPPREF for instructions on how to select the
% ODE solver used, or how to enforce a global method to be used. 
% 
% Example (solving an IVP by automatically converting it to first order form):
%
%   % Solve the van der Pol equation u'' - 20*(1-u^2)u' + u = 0, u(0)=2, u'(0)=0
%   vdpFun = @(u) diff(u, 2) - 20*(1-u.^2).*diff(u) + u;
%   dom = [0 100];
%   N = chebop(vdpFun, dom);
%   N.lbc = [2; 0];
%   u = N\0
%   plot(u)
%
% %% PARAMETER DEPENDENT PROBLEMS %%
%
% CHEBOP supports solving systems of equations containing unknown parameters
% without the need to introduce extra equations into the system. Simply add the
% unknown parameters in the list of arguments to the operator. By default, any
% variable that is not acted on by differentiation or integration is treated as
% a parameter, rather than a function. The exception is when no variable
% appearing in a problem is differentiated or integrated, in which case, all
% variables get treated as functions, rather than parameters.
%
% Example (unknown parameter in differential equation):
%
%   % y'' + x.*y + p = 0, y(-1) = 1, y'(-1) = 0, y(1) = 1 can be solved via
%   N = chebop(@(x, y, p) diff(y,2) + x.*y + p);
%   N.lbc = @(y, p) [y - 1 ; diff(y)];
%   N.rbc = @(y, p) y - 1;
%   plot(N\0)
%
% Example (unknown parameter in boundary condition):
%
%   % u'' + u = 0, u(0) = 0, u(1) = 2, u'(0) = p
%   N = chebop(@(x, u, p) diff(u,2) + u, [0 1]);
%   N.bc = @(x, u, p) [u(0); u(1) - 2; feval(diff(u), 0) - p];
%   up = N\0;
%   plot(up), [u, p] = deal(up)
%
% Example (no differentiation/integration)
%
%   % Find u and v on [-1, 1] s.t. u^2 - x + sin(v) = v + exp(v) + u = sin(4x)+2
%   x = chebfun('x');
%   f = sin(4*x) + 2;
%   N = chebop(@(x,u,v) [u.^2 - x + sin(v); v + exp(v) + u]);
%   [u, v] = N\[f; f]
%
% It is possible to explicitly pass parameters as parts of the initial guess for
% a nonlinear problem by assigning it to the appropriate entry of a CHEBMATRIX
% input to N.init.
%
% Example:
%
%   N = chebop(@(x, p, y) diff(y,2) + x.*y.^2 + p);
%   N.lbc = @(p, y) [y - 1 ; diff(y)];
%   N.rbc = @(p, y) y - 1;
%   N.init = [1 ; chebfun(1)];
%   plot(N\0)
%
% %% AUTOMATIC VECTORIZATION %%
%
% By default, CHEBOP will automatically try to vectorize anonymous function that
% get passed as OP, BC, LBC and RBC. For example, the function VDPFUN from the
% IVP example above,
%
%   vdpFun = @(u) diff(u, 2) - 20*(1-u.^2).*diff(u) + u;
%
% could have equally been written as
%
%   vdpFun = @(u) diff(u, 2) - 20*(1-u^2)*diff(u) + u;
%
% To turn off the automatic vectorization, set N.vectorize = false, or change
% the default CHEBOPPREF via cheboppref.setDefaults('vectorize', false).
%
%
% %% MAXNORM %%
%
% Through the events capabilities of Matlab's built-in ODE solvers, it is
% possible to enforce solver for IVPs to bail out of the solution process if a
% maximum norm of the solution is exceeded. This is particularly useful for
% problems that blow up in finite time. The information is passed through the
% MAXNORM field of the CHEBOP. In case of a coupled system, a vector can be
% passed.
%
%   Example (scalar problem, stop solver once |u| > 10 )
%       T = 30 ; N = chebop(0,T); t = chebfun('t',[0,T]); N.maxnorm = 10;
%       N.op = @(t,y) diff(y,2)+y-0.09*y^3; N.lbc = [-1; 0];
%       y = N\sin(0.05*t); plot(y,diff(y))
%
%   Example (Lotka-Volterra, stop if |u| > 1 or |v| > 5 )
%       N = chebop(@(t,u,v) [diff(u)-2.*u+u.*v; diff(v)+v-u.*v], [0 10]);
%       N.lbc = @(u, v) [u-.5; v-1]; N.maxnorm = [1 5];
%       [u,v] = N\0; plot([u, v])
%
% If the solver bails out before the specified end time T, the solution returned
% will include a piece of a NaN CHEBFUN on the time interval from when the
% solver stops until T. Note that the detection only works if the solution
% crosses the threshold, so if the initial condition violates the maxnorm
% condition, the solver is likely to miss it.
