function [u, disc] = linsolve(L, f, varargin)
%LINSOLVE  Solve a linear differential/integral equation.
%   Important: While you can construct a LINOP and apply this method, the 
%   recommended procedure is to use CHEBOP.MLDIVIDE instead. 
%   
%   U = LINSOLVE(L, F), or U = L\F, solves the linear system defined by L*U=F
%   for a linop L and chebmatrix F. The result is a chebmatrix.
%
%   Parameters controlling the method of solution are found and set using
%   L.prefs. 
%
%   U = LINSOLVE(L, F, CDISC) uses the chebDiscretization CDISC to solve the
%   problem. This can be used, for example, to introduce new breakpoints that
%   are not in the domain of either L or F.
%
%   EXAMPLE:
%     d = [0,pi];
%     [Z,I,D] = linop.primitiveOperators(d);
%     A = linop( D^2 - I );
%     E = functionalBlock.eval(d);
%     A = addBC(A,E(0),0);
%     A = addBC(A,E(pi),1);
%     u = A \ chebfun('x',d);
%     plot(u{1})
