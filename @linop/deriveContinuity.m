function L = deriveContinuity(L, dom, makePeriodic)
%DERIVECONTINUITY Continuity conditions in a piecewise domain.
%   L = DERIVECONTINUITY(L) examines the domain of L and the differential
%   orders of the variables in the system, in order to deduce and encode
%   the appropriate continuity conditions for each variable at every
%   breakpoint. The results are stored in the 'continuity' property of L.
%
%   L has a property called hasGivenJumpAt that signals where automatic
%   continuity conditions are NOT to be applied, because they have been
%   given explicitly in the constraints. 
%
%   L = DERIVECONTINUITY(L,DOMAIN) uses the given domain, merged with
%   L.DOMAIN, in order to derive continuity. In this way you can introduce
%   new breakpoints.
%
%   L = DERIVECONTINUITY(L,DOMAIN,TRUE) ignores breakpoints and enforces
%   appropriate continuity at the boundary points, in order to create a
%   constraint of periodicity. This is called by ADDBC, which then moves
%   the conditions to the 'constraint' property.
