%SPINSCHEME   Abstract class for representing time-stepping schemes.
%   SPINSCHEME is an abstract class for representing time-stepping schemes.
%   Full implementations are EXPINT (exponential integrators) and IMEX 
%   (implicit-explcit schemes).

    methods ( Access = public, Abstract = false, Static = false )
        
        % Compute coefficients of a SPINSCHEME:
        schemeCoeffs = computeCoeffs(K, dt, L, M, S)
        
        % Do one step of a SPINSCHEME:
        [uSol, NuSol] = oneStep(K, dt, schemeCoeffs, Nc, Nv, nVars, S, uSol, NuSol)
        
        % Get enough initial data when using a multistep SPINSCHEME:
        [uSol, NuSol] = startMultistep(K, dt, L, Nc, Nv, pref, S, uSol, NuSol)
        
    end
