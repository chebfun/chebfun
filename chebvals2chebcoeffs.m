%CHEBVALS2CHEBCOEFFS  Convert Chebyshev values to coefficients.
% 	CHEBCOEFFS = CHEBVALS2CHEBCOEFFS(CHEBVALS), converts the column vector
%   CHEBVALS of values on a second-kind Chebyshev grid (i.e, F(CHEBPTS(N))) to
%   a vector CHEBCOEFFS of the Chebyshev coefficients of the series
%       F(X) = C_CHEB(1)*T0(X) + ... + C_CHEB(N)*T{N-1}(X).
