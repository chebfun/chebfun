%CHEBCOLLOC2    Collocation discretization on 2nd kind points.
%   CHEBCOLLOC2 is an implementation of CHEBCOLLOC that implements spectral
%   collocation on 2nd-kind Chebyshev points for differential and integral
%   operators.
%
%   Linear algebra operations generally take O(N^3) flops, where N is determined
%   automatically to resolve the solution. You can control the allowed values of
%   N through CHEBOPPREF.
