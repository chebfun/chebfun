function [x, w, v] = radaupts(n, alp, bet)
%RADAUPTS   Gauss-Jacobi-Radau quadrature nodes and weights.
%  RADAUPTS(N) returns N Legendre-Radau points X in [-1,1).
%
%  [X, W] = RADAUPTS(N) returns also a row vector W of weights for
%  Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature.
%
%  [X, W, V] = RADAUPTS(N) returns additionally a column vector V of weights in
%  the barycentric formula corresponding to the points X. The weights are scaled
%  so that max(abs(V)) = 1.
%
%  [...] = RADUAPTS(N, ALP, BET) is similar, but for the Gauss-Jacobi-Radau
%  nodes and weights. Here ALP and BET should be scalars > -1.
%
%  In each case, N should be a positive integer.

% Developer note:
%   The approach used here is to observe that the Gauss-Radau points are
%   precisely the roots of (1+x)P^(0,1)_{n-2}(x), which can be obtained from
%   JACPTS. A similar identity [NIST, (18.9.5) and (18.9.17)] is used for the
%   computation of the quadrature weights from those of JACPTS, and the missing
%   barycentric weights are determined by enforcing the interpolation of f(x) =
%   x at x = 0.
%
%    x_j = roots of (1+x)P^(0,1)_{n-2}(x)
%    w_j = { 2/n^2                                 : x_j = -1
%          { 1/(1-x_j) * 1/[d/dx P_{n-1}(x_j)]^2   : otherwise
%
%   (Note that the weights for n-1 point Gauss-Jacobi with a = 0, b = 1 satisfy 
%    u_j = C/(1-x_j^2)/[d/dx P^(0,1)_{n-1}(x_j)]^2)
