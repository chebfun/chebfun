function varargout = plot(A, varargin)
%PLOT   Plot for CHEBMATRIX objects.
%   PLOT(A) plots the CHEBMATRIX object A.
%
%   If A contains only CHEBFUN and DOUBLE objects, A is converted to a
%   QUASIMATRIX, and CHEBFUN/PLOT() is called. In this case PLOT(A, S) allows
%   various line types, plot symbols, and colors to be used, where S is a
%   character string. See CHEBFUN/PLOT() for further details.
%
%   If A contains inf x inf blocks, CHEBMATRIX/SPY() is called. In this case
%   SPY(A, DIM, DISCTYPE) uses the dimension vector DIM and the discretization
%   DISCTYPE for the visualization. See CHEBMATRIX/SPY() for further details.
%
%   H = PLOT(...) will return the figure handle handle from the plot in the case
%   when CHEBFUN/PLOT() is called, but throw an error for CHEBMATRIX/SPY().
