classdef (InferiorClasses = {?chebfun, ?operatorBlock, ?functionalBlock}) chebmatrix
%CHEBMATRIX Compound matrix for operators, chebfuns, and scalars.
%   A chebmatrix contains blocks that are linear operators, functionals,
%   chebfuns, or scalars. They are used to tie together multiple functions, or
%   functions and scalars, as unknowns in a system, and to express linear
%   operators on those objects.
%
%   Normally the CHEBMATRIX constructor is not called directly. Instead, one
%   uses the usual [ ] or concatenation commands familiar for matrices. Block
%   sizes must be compatible, where function dimensions have size Inf. All
%   functions and operators in a chebmatrix must share compatible domains; i.e.,
%   they should all have the same endpoints. The resulting chebmatrix domain
%   includes all the breakpoints of the constituent blocks.
% 
%   Chebmatrices obey the expected arithmetic operations, such as + and *, if
%   the sizes are appropriate. 
%
%   If a chebmatrix contains only chebfuns, then the CHEBFUN method converts it
%   to an array-valued chebfun so that plotting and other commands work on it
%   normally. 
%
%   Examples:
%     d = [-2 2];   % function domain
%     I = operatorBlock.eye(d);     % identity operator
%     D = operatorBlock.diff(d);    % differentiation operator
%     x = chebfun(@(x) x, d);       % the variable x on d
%     M = operatorBlock.mult(x.^2); % multiplication operator
%     S = functionalBlock.sum(d);   % integration functional 
%     E = functionalBlock.eval(d);  % evaluation functional generator
% 
%     u = [ exp(x); pi; sin(x) ];   %  function; scalar; function
%     A = [ I+D, abs(x), M;
%           S, 0, E(2);  
%           D, x.^2, I ];
%
%     dA = A.domain                 % includes breakpoint at zero
%     sz = size(A)                  % 3 by 3 block array
%     [Am, An] = blockSizes(A)      % sizes of the blocks
%
%     spy(A)                % show the block structures
%     matrix(A, [4 4])      % discretize with 4 points in each subdomain
%     matrix(A*u, [4 4]) 
%
%     A21 = A(2, 1);    % get just the (2,1) block
%     A21.domain        % no breakpoint
%     matrix(A21,6)     % Clenshaw-Curtis weights

% Developer notes
%
% CHEBMATRIX is the class that enables concatenating various classes of objects
% of Chebfun into a single object. It has four fields:
%   * blocks: A Matlab cell used to store the components.
%   * domain: The domain of the componenents, including the union of all
%             breakpoints.
%   * diffOrder: A dependent property. diffOrder is matrix valued, with values
%                corresponding to the diffOrders of each components, so that
%                each order of differentiation gives +1, and each order of
%                anti-derivative gives -1.
