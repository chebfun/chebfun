% A. Townsend, March 2013

%% 5.1 WHAT IS A CHEBFUN2V? 
% Chebfun2v objects represent vector valued functions. We use a lower case
% letter, $f$, for a chebfun2 object and an upper case letter, $F$, for a
% chebfun2v object. 

%%
% Chebfun2v represents a vector-valued function $F(x,y) = (f(x,y);g(x,y))$ 
% by approximating each component by a low rank approximant. 
% There are two ways to form a chebfun2v object: either by explicitly 
% calling the constructor or by vertical concatenation of two chebfun2 objects. 
% Here are these two alternatives:

d = [0 1 0 2];
F = chebfun2v(@(x,y) sin(x.*y), @(x,y) cos(y),d); % calling the constructor
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) sin(x.*y),d); g = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(y),d);
G = [f;g]                                         % vertical concatenation

%% 
% Displaying a chebfun2v shows that it is a vector of two chebfun2
% objects.

%% 5.2 ALGEBRAIC OPERATIONS 
% Chebfun2v objects are useful for performing 2D vector
% calculus. The basic algebraic operations are scalar multiplication, 
% vector addition, dot product and cross product. 

%%
% Scalar multiplication is the product of a scalar function with a 
% vector function:

f = chebfun2(@(x,y) exp( -(x.*y).^2/20 ) ,d);
f*F

%%  
% Vector addition yields another chebfun2v and satisfies the 
% parallelogram law:

plaw = abs((2*norm(F)^2 + 2*norm(G)^2) - (norm(F+G)^2 + norm(F-G)^2));
fprintf('Parallelogram law holds with error = %10.5e\n',plaw)


%%
% The dot product combines two vector functions into a scalar function. 
% If the dot product of two chebfun2v objects takes the value 
% zero at some (x,y) then the vector valued functions are orthogonal at 
% (x,y).  For example, the following code segment determines a curve along
% which two vector-valued functions are orthogonal:

F = chebfun2v(@(x,y) sin(x.*y), @(x,y) cos(y),d);
G = chebfun2v(@(x,y) cos(4*x.*y), @(x,y) x + x.*y.^2,d);
plot(roots(dot(F,G))), axis equal, axis(d)

%% 
% The cross product for 2D vector fields is

%% 5.3 DIFFERENTIAL OPERATIONS
% Vector calculus also involves various differential operators defined 
% on scalar or vector valued functions such as gradient, 
% curl, divergence, and Laplacian.

%%
% The gradient of a chebfun2 is, geometrically, the direction and magnitude 
% of steepest ascent of f. If the gradient of f is 0 at (x,y) then f has a 
% critical point at (x,y). Here are the
% critical points of a sum of Gaussian bumps:

f = chebfun2(0);
for k = 1:10 
    x0 = 2*rand-1; y0=2*rand-1;
    f = f + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-10*((x-x0).^2 + (y-y0).^2)));
end

r = roots(gradient(f));

%%
% The curl of 2D vector function is a scalar function defined by

help chebfun2v/curl 

%%
% If the chebfun2v F describes a vector velocity field of fluid flow, 
% for example, then curl(F) is the scalar function equal
% to twice the angular speed of a particle in the flow at each point. 
% A particle moving in a gradient field has zero angular speed and hence,
% the curl of the gradient is zero.  We can check this numerically:

norm(curl(gradient(f)))

%% 
% The divergence of a chebfun2v is defined as 

help chebfun2v/divergence

%%
% This measures a vector field's distribution of sources or sinks.  
% The Laplacian is closely related and is the divergence of the gradient,

norm(laplacian(f) - divergence(gradient(f)))

%% 5.4 LINE INTEGRALS 
% Given a vector field F we can compute the line integral along a curve
% with the command integral, as defined as

help chebfun2v/integral

%%
% The gradient theorem says that if F is a gradient field then the 
% line integral along a smooth curve only depends on the end points of that
% curve. We can check this numerically:

f = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(10*x.*y.^2) + exp(-x.^2));% chebfun2 object
F = gradient(f);                                  % gradient (chebfun2v)
C = chebfun(@(t) t.*exp(10i*t),[0 1]);            % spiral curve
v = integral(F,C);ends = f(cos(10),sin(10))-f(0,0);% line integral
abs(v-ends)                                       % gradient theorem

%% 5.5 PHASE PORTRAIT
% A phase portrait is a graphical representation of a system of 
% trajectories for a two variable autonomous dynamical system. Note there is 
% an unfortunate double meaning to "phase portrait" it can either mean a phase portrait 
% of a complex-valued function (see chapter 4 of the guide) or a graphical
% representation of an autonomous system. In this section we are talking 
% about autonomous systems. In Chebfun2 we can plot phase 
% portraits by using the quiver command, which has been overloaded to 
% plot the vector field. 
% 
% In addition, Chebfun2 makes it easy to compute and plot individual 
% trajectories of a vector field. If F is a chebfun2v, then 
% ode45(F,tspan,y0) solves the autonomous system dx/dt=f(x,y), dy/dt=g(x,y),
% where f and g are the first and second components of F. Given a 
% prescribed time interval and initial conditions, this command returns a 
% complex valued chebfun representing the trajectory in the form 
% $x(t) + iy(t)$. For example:

d = 0.04; a=1; b=-.75;
F = chebfun2v(@(x,y)y, @(x,y)-d*y - b*x - a*x.^3, [-2 2 -2 2]);
[t y]=ode45(F,[0 40],[0,.5]);
plot(y,'r'), hold on,
quiver(F,'b'), axis equal
