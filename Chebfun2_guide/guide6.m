%% CHEBFUN2 GUIDE 6: 2D SURFACES IN 3D SPACE
% A. Townsend, March 2013

%% 6.1 REPRESENTING PARAMETRIC SURFACES
% In Chapter 5, we explored chebfun2v objects with two components, but
% Chebfun2 can also work with functions with three components, i.e.,
% functions from a rectangle in $R^2$ into $R^3$. For example, we can 
% represent the unit sphere via spherical 
% coordinates as follows:

th = chebfun2(@(th,phi) th, [0 pi 0 2*pi]);
phi = chebfun2(@(th,phi) phi, [0 pi 0 2*pi]);

x = sin(th).*cos(phi);
y = sin(th).*sin(phi);
z = cos(th); 

F = [x;y;z]; 
surf(F), camlight, axis equal

%%
% Above, we have formed a chebfun2v with three components by vertical 
% concatenation of chebfun2 objects. However, for familiar surfaces such as
% cylinders, spheres, and ellipsoids Chebfun2 has overloaded the commands
% CYLINDER, SPHERE, and ELLIPSOID to generate these surfaces more easily. 
% For example, a cylinder of radius 1 and height 5 can be constructed like this:

h = 5; 
r = chebfun(@(th) 1+0*th,[0 h]);
F = cylinder(r);
surf(F), camlight

%% 
% An important class of parametric surfaces are surfaces of revolution,
% which are formed by revolving a curve in the left half plane about the
% z-axis. The CYLINDER command can be used to generate surfaces of 
% revolution. For example: 

f = chebfun(@(t) (sin(pi*t)+1.1).*t.*(t-10),[0 5]);
F = cylinder(f);
surf(F), camlight

%% 6.2 SURFACE NORMALS AND DIVERGENCE THEOREM
% Given a chebfun2v representing a surface, the normal can be computed by 
% the Chebfun2v NORMAL command.  Here are the normal vectors of a torus:

r1 = 1; r2 = 1/3;   % inner and outer radius
d = [0 2*pi 0 2*pi];
u = chebfun2(@(u,v) u,d);
v = chebfun2(@(u,v) v,d);
F = [-(r1+r2*cos(v)).*sin(u); (r1+r2*cos(v)).*cos(u); r2*sin(v)];  % torus

surf(F), camlight, hold on
quiver3(F(1),F(2),F(3),normal(F, 'unit'),'numpts',10)
axis equal, hold off

%%
% Once we have the surface normal vectors we can compute, for instance, 
% the volume of the torus by applying the Divergence theorem:
% $$\int\int_V\int div(G) dV = \int_S\int G\cdot d\mathbf{S},$$
% where $div(G)=1$. Instead of integrating over the 3D volume, which is 
% currently not possible in Chebfun2, we integrate over the 2D surface:

G = F./3;  % full 3D divergence of G is 1 because F = [x;y;z]. 
integral2(dot(G,normal(F)))
exact = 2*pi^2*r1*r2.^2

%%
% Chebfun2v objects with three components come with a warning. Chebfun2
% works with functions of two real variables and therefore, operations such
% as curl and divergence (in 2D) have little physical meaning to the 
% represented 3D surface.  The reason we can compute the 
% volume of the torus (above) is because we are using the Divergence Theorem and
% circumventing the 3D divergence.

%%
% To finish this section we represent the Klein Bagel. The solid black 
% line shows the parameterisation seam and is displayed with the syntax 
% surf(F,'-'). See [Platte March 2013] for more on parameterised surfaces.

u = chebfun2(@(u,v) u, [0 2*pi 0 2*pi]);
v = chebfun2(@(u,v) v, [0 2*pi 0 2*pi]);
x=(3+cos(u/2).*sin(v)-sin(u/2).*sin(2*v)).*cos(u);
y=(3+cos(u/2).*sin(v)-sin(u/2).*sin(2*v)).*sin(u);
z=sin(u/2).*sin(v)+cos(u/2).*sin(2*v);
