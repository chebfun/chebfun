classdef (InferiorClasses = {?bndfun, ?unbndfun}) deltafun < fun
%DELTAFUN   Class for distributions based on Dirac-deltas on arbitrary intervals
%
%   Class for approximating generalized functions on the interval [a, b].
%   The smooth or classical part of the function is approximated by a
%   CLASSICFUN object while the Dirac delta functions are represented by a
%   pair of properties: DELTAMAG and LOCATION, which store the magnitude
%   and the location of the delta functions respectively. DELTAMAG is
%   generally a matrix, with its first row representing the delta functions,
%   while derivatives of delta functions are represented by higher rows of
%   this matrix. LOCATION is a vector, each element of which corresponds to
%   the location of a column in the DELTAMAG matrix.
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   DELTAFUN([], DATA) creates a DELTAFUN object with an empty FUNPART, with
%   the delta functions and their locations specified by the following fields in
%   the DATA structure:
%     DATA.DELTAMAG    (Default:  Empty)
%         Delta function magnitude matrix.  (See description above.)
%     DATA.DELTALOC    (Default:  Empty)
%         Row vector of locations of delta functions.
%
%   DELTAFUN(FUNPART, DATA) creates a DELTAFUN object with FUNPART as its
%   smooth function, while the locations and magnitudes of the delta functions
%   are specified by the DATA structure as above.
%
%   DELTAFUN(FUNPART, DATA, PREF) is the same as above but uses PREF to pass
%   any preferences.
%
%   DELTAFUN(OP, DATA, PREF) will call the CLASSICFUN constructor to create a
%   FUNPART out of the operator OP.  Fields in DATA which are not among those
%   listed above as recognized by DELTAFUN will be passed to the CLASSICFUN
%   constructor as-is.
%
%   DELTAFUN(F, ...) where F is a DELTAFUN simply returns F, i.e., other inputs
%   are ignored.
