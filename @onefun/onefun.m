classdef onefun % (Abstract) 
%ONEFUN     Approximate smooth functions on [-1,1]. 
%   Abstract (interface) class for approximating functions on the interval
%   [-1,1].
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   ONEFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF) creates a representation of the
%   operator OP defined on the interval [-1,1]. If PREF.ONEFUN.BLOWUP = 1 (which
%   is the default) then the ONEFUN constructor calls
%    SINGFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF2), else it calls
%    SMOOTHFUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF2) if PREF.ONEFUN.BLOWUP = 0, 
%   where in both cases PREF2 is a merge of PREF with the default SINGFUN and
%   ONEFUN preferences, respectively.
%
%   See SMOOTHFUN and SINGFUN for further documentation.

% ONEFUN Class Description:
%
% The ONEFUN class is an abstract class for representations of functions on the
% interval [-1,1].
%
% The current instances of ONEFUNs are SMOOTHFUNs and SINGFUNs. The former are
% used to represenet smooth functions on [-1,1}, whereas the latter are able to
% represent some forms of endpoint singularites.

    %% Properties of ONEFUN objects.
    properties ( Access = public )

        % Vertical scale of the ONEFUN. This is an estimate for the magnitude of
        % the largest entry of the ONEFUN. For an array-valued ONEFUN, VSCALE is
        % an row vector and the kth entry corresponds to the kth column in the
        % ONEFUN.
        vscale = 0 % (1xm double >= 0)

        % Horizontal scale of the ONEFUN. Although ONEFUN objects have in
        % principle no notion of horizontal scale invariance (since they always
        % live on [-1,1]), the input OP may have been implicitly mapped. HSCALE
        % is then used to enforce horizontal scale invariance in construction
        % and other subsequent operations that require it. It defaults to 1 and
        % is never updated.
        hscale = 1 % (scalar > 0)

        % Boolean value designating whether the ONEFUN is a 'happy'
        % representation or not. (See subclasses for further documentation.)
        ishappy % (logical)

        % Happiness level to which the ONEFUN was constructed, or a rough
        % accuracy estimate of subsequent operations. (See subclasses for
        % further documentation.)
