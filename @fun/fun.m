classdef fun % (Abstract)
%FUN   Represent global functions on an interval [a, b].
%
%   Abstract (interface) class for representing global functions on an interval
%   [a, b], which can either be bounded or unbounded. Functions are
%   approximated via a ONEFUN object, which lives on the interval [-1, 1],
%   stored in the FUN.  Forward and inverse maps stored in the FUN object map
%   the interval [-1, 1] to [a, b], and vice versa.
%
% Constructor inputs:
%   FUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, DOMAIN) constructs a FUN object from the function handle
%   OP by mapping the DOMAIN to [-1, 1], and constructing an ONEFUN object to
%   represent the function prescribed by OP. DOMAIN should be a row vector with
%   two elements in increasing order. OP should be vectorised (i.e., accept a
%   vector input) and output a vector of the same length as its input.
%
%   FUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, DOMAIN, VSCALE, HSCALE) allows the constructor of the
%   ONEFUN of the FUN to use information about vertical and horizontal scales.
%   If not given (or given as empty), the VSCALE defaults to 0 initially, and
%   HSCALE defaults to 1.
%
%   FUN.CONSTRUCTOR(OP, DOMAIN, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF) overrides the default
%   behavior with that given by the CHEBPREF object PREF. See CHEBPREF for
%   details.
%
%   FUN.CONSTRUCTOR(VALUES, DOMAIN, VSCALE, HSCALE, PREF) returns a FUN object
%   with a ONEFUN constructed by the data in the columns of VALUES (if supported
%   by ONEFUN class constructor).
%
% See ONEFUN for further documentation of the ONEFUN class.

% FUN Class Description:
%
% The FUN class is an abstract class for representations of functions on the
% interval [a, b]. It achieves this by taking a ONEFUN on [-1, 1] and applying
% a mapping.
%
% The current instances of FUNs are BNDFUNs and UNBNDFUNs. The former are used
% to represent functions on bounded domains, whereas the latter are able to
% represent some functions on unbounded domains.
%
% Note that all binary FUN operators (methods which can take two FUN arguments)
% assume that the domains of the FUN objects agree. The methods will not throw
% warnings in case the domains don't agree, but their output will not be
% meaningful.
