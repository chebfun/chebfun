function c_cheb = jac2cheb(c_jac, alph, bet)
%JAC2CHEB convert Legendre coefficients to Chebyshev coefficients. 
%   C_CHEB = JAC2CHEB(C_JAC, A, B) converts the vector C_JAC of Jacobi
%   coefficients to a vector C_CHEB of Chebyshev coefficients such that
%       C_CHEB(1)*T_0(x) + ... + C_CHEB(N)*T{N-1}(x) = ...
%           C_JAC(1)*P_0^{(A,B)}(x) + ... + C_JAC(N)*P_{N-1}^{(A,B)},
%   where P_k^{(A,B)} is the degree k Jacobi polynomial corresponding to the
%   weight function w(x) = (1-X)^A * (1+X)^B.
%
%   If C_LEG is a matrix then the LEG2CHEB operation is applied to each column.
